Our model can serve as a strong basis for analyzing tweets pertaining to Hong Kong horse racing and public perception surrounding certain horses. Because horse racing odds in a parimutel betting market are directly reliant upon the betting public, having a model that is able to succesfully classify (most of the time) the sentiment behind any tweet concerning any race, course, or horse, we become even closer to identifying not only all factors relating to what drives the public to bet the way they do, but also quantifying the influence of the betting public. These findings will be reported in the final conclusive report generated from this project, likely alongside the generated model predicting sentiment behind actual HKJC-related tweets."

    "text": "(Section adapted from Analytics Vidhya)\n\n\nNaive Bayes Classification is a supervised machine learning technique that is used to classify data into given classes/categories based on a set of features in a data set. Naive Bayes algorithims essentially model a distribution of inputs for a given class/category. Naive Bayes classifiers are considered very simple classfication models in machine learning. A Naive Bayes algorthim utilizes Bayes’ theorem in order to apply a probability that a given data observation belongs to a certain class or category. This probability is used then to assign a classification to the observation. This probability is called the posterior probability. The equation for posterior probability can be seen below.\n\n\n\nBayes Theorem\n\n\n(I will make sure this is higher resolution later.)\nIn our case, c is equal to the class when we are trying to predict and x is equal to a predictor, an attribute of our dataset. Our computers are able to very quickly generate these probabilities for all of our predictors of interest and then assign a class to a data observation based on the highest posterior probability. It is important to note that an important assumption of Naive Bayes Classifcation is that all predictors are independent of each other.\nNaive Bayes is a very fast and easy way to generate classification predicitions and performs very well in cases of categorical input variables compared to numerical variables (where normality is assumed for these variables).

Naive Bayes algorithims essentially model a distribution of inputs for a given class/category. Naive Bayes classifiers are considered very simple classfication models in machine learning. A Naive Bayes algorthim utilizes Bayes’ theorem in order to apply a probability that a given data observation belongs to a certain class or category. This probability is used then to assign a classification to the observation. This probability is called the posterior probability. The equation for posterior probability can be seen below.\n\n\n\nBayes Theorem\n\n\n(I will make sure this is higher resolution later.)\nIn our case, c is equal to the class when we are trying to predict and x is equal to a predictor, an attribute of our dataset. Our computers are able to very quickly generate these probabilities for all of our predictors of interest and then assign a class to a data observation based on the highest posterior probability. It is important to note that an important assumption of Naive Bayes Classifcation is that all predictors are independent of each other.\nNaive Bayes is a very fast and easy way to generate classification predicitions and performs very well in cases of categorical input variables compared to numerical variables (where normality is assumed for these variables). When the assumption of independence holds, Naive Bayes often performs better than other machine learning methods like logistic regression, but this assumption of independence can also serve as a major detriment to this algorithim as in real life, it is very unlikely we have a set of predictors that are completely independent."

The increased emphasis on our numerical feature set comes from the fact that our numerical features appear to be more significant than our categorical features in terms of explaining a horse’s race performance and also due to the fact that previous sections, like our Classification section, have already explored a lot of the nuances of our categorical feature set.

Every data point is randomly assigned to a centroid and centroids are recalculated a mean of all their assigned datapoints. 3.

DBSAN takes into account that data may adhere to clusters of arbitrary shapes or contain noise that impacts the shape of the cluster. DBSCAN is also robust to outliers and does not require us to specify a certain number of clusters. On top of all these advantages, DBSCAN is a computationally fast algorithim, all things considered.\nYou may be asking yourself, with all of these advantages to DBSCAN, why would we consider any other algorithim for clustering? For one, DBSCAN requires drops in density between cluster borders, so if you have datapoints in potential clusters that are fairly overlapping, DBSCAN is going to have a hard time delineating the clusters, probably assigning all the data points to one “mega cluster”. Also, DBSCAN struggles to detect clusters with varying density and also really struggles with high-dimensional data. If you do feel as though there is not a lot of density drop in clusters or significantly irregular density fluctuations in your clusters, DBSCAN should NOT be used. Otherwise, DBSCAN can serve as a formidable technique to dealing with anomalous datapoints and/or non-convex clusters."

An example image of a dendrogram can be seen below (the orginal image can be found in the above link).\n\n\n\nDendrogram\n\n\nDendrograms can be derived either through agglomerative clustering or divsive clustering. In agglomerative clustering, data points are first considered as their own subclusters, and then through defining a distance metric (e.g. Euclidean distance), we measure the distance between all of our subclusters and merge the two nearest subclusters, repeating this process until we are left with one cluster, the “top” of the dendrogram.\nIn divisive clustering, we performing a “top down” approach to developing our dendrogram. We iteratively perform the process of k-means on our data, starting from the datset as a whole, all the way until we have k clusters equal to the amount of datapoints in the dataset, or the number of clusters you so desire in your dendrogram.\nHierarchical clustering allows us to create clusters out of very complex shapes of data and also gives us a fairly simple medium of interpretation through the dendrogram. We are able to manually pick the number of clusters that we see as significant, which can be advantageous, but also disadvantegous if our data is complex as interpreting dendrograms is heavily driven by heuristics. This heuristical process allows us serious benefits in interpreation, but does require us to be heavily knowledged about our data."

This analysis will include looking at univariate, bivariate, and multivariate summary statistics and visualizations of the data, analyzing the relationships between the features in our data sets, analyzing parsimonious models that can be developed with the data, and beginning to develop some of the foundational knowledge and early conjecture pertaining to next steps in developing more advanced classifiers and predictive models.\nReading in our data.\n\nhorses &lt;- read.csv(\"../../../data/01-modified-data/horses.clean.csv\")\nperf &lt;- read.csv(\"../../../data/01-modified-data/perf.clean.csv\")\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\n\n\nLet’s first take a look at one of our biggest overarching questions: what attributes of a horse have the most impact on their outcome in a race. Due to the fact that the performance data set contains information on races of 25 DIFFERENT TRACK LENGTHS, and the length of a race is likely very much so NOT independent of a horse’s attributes, the following data visualizations will be grouped by these race lengths. Because looking at 25 different track lengths on a singular visualization would be too messy to glean any information from, I decided to break the data into 3 distinct groups by creating a new variable in our data called “race_length”. The groups will be races below 1600m (1 mile), races between 1600m and 2000m, and races over 2000m.\n\nfor(i in 1:nrow(perf)){\n  \n  if(perf$distance[i] &lt; 1600){\n    perf$race_length[i] &lt;- \"Less than 1600m\"\n  } else if(perf$distance[i] &gt;= 1600 & perf$distance[i] &lt;= 2000){\n    perf$race_length[i] &lt;- \"1600m - 2000m\"\n  } else if(perf$distance[i] &gt; 2000){\n    perf$race_length[i] &lt;- \"More than 2000m\"\n  }\n  \n}\n\nLet’s take look at the distribution of horse race lengths.\n\ntable(perf$race_length)\n\n\n  1600m - 2000m Less than 1600m More than 2000m \n         108922          157310            7761 \n\n\nWe can see that the majority of races were less than 1600m, followed relatively closely by races between 1600m and 2000m, and then lastly, races more than 2000m. The distribution of the data is fairly evenly distributed across race lengths, all things considered. We do not need to treat one of the race length groups as an outlier to the data.\nNow we will start to build visualizations.\n\ng1&lt;- ggplot(perf,aes(x=rating,y=final_placing))+geom_jitter()\ng1\n\nWarning: Removed 7615 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon the initial creation of this plot, we can see that we have some errors in our data where there are final placings of 47 and 99. We are going to delete these points. We also have anomalies where ratings are 333 and 951, which we will also remove.\n\nperf&lt;- perf%&gt;%\n  filter(rating &lt; 250 & final_placing != 47 & final_placing != 99)\n\nNow we re-create our plot, along with cleaned formatting.\n\n# Re-ordering factor levels for legend\nperf$race_length &lt;- factor(perf$race_length, levels = c(\"More than 2000m\", \"1600m - 2000m\", \"Less than 1600m\"))\ng1&lt;- ggplot(perf,aes(x=rating,y=final_placing,color=race_length))+\n  geom_point()+\n  ggtitle(\"Horse Rating vs. Final Race Placing\")+\n  xlab(\"Horse Rating\")+\n  ylab(\"Final Placing\")+\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = \"Race Length\"))+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(1,14,by=1))\ng1\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see above, there is a fairly even distribution of placements when we are looking at horse rankings for each race length. This plot helps us understand that historically, horses of all rankings have come in last place, first place, and everywhere in between. We can see, however, that there might be a small pattern happening towards the end of the x-axis: higher ranking horses look like they do not place low frequently and vice versa for lower ranked horses. In order to examine this potential pattern, lets only looking at horses with ranking 125 and up.\n\nperf.rating.filter &lt;- perf %&gt;%\n  filter(rating &gt;= 125)\ng2&lt;- ggplot(perf.rating.filter,aes(x=rating,y=final_placing,color=race_length))+\n  geom_jitter()+\n  ggtitle(\"Horse Rating vs. Final Race Placing\")+\n  xlab(\"Horse Rating\")+\n  ylab(\"Final Placing\")+\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = \"Race Length\"))+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(1,14,by=1))\ng2\n\n\n\n\nHere, we are able to get a better gauge on how rating impacts final placement in a race. We can see that if a horse is above about a 135 rating, it becomes exceedingly rare for them to place below 10th. As we move on to a rating of 140, it becomes rare for the horse to place below 5th. These phenomena apply to races of all lengths (with races between 1600m and 2000m being the most common race). This knowledge becomes helpful when we eventually use horse rating to help determine the probability a horse has a podium finish (placement in the top 3).\nMost horses, however, do not exceed ratings of 130 at the HJKC. Even still, the density of the data points is far higher at better placements for horses between 125 and 130. Horse rating certainly plays a role in determining if it wins (especially since rating is a metric derived from a horse’s past performance and attributes).\n\n\n\nFor every horse race, horses are given a starting position in the starting gates based on a random draw. There is often debate over what draw is best for a horse given the different lengths of races. I will be creating a plot to explore this debate and visualize how starting draw has affected final race placement among horses at HKJC.\n\ng3&lt;- ggplot(perf.rating.filter,aes(x=draw,y=final_placing,color=race_length))+\n  geom_count(aes(size = stat(prop)))+\n  ggtitle(\"Starting Draw vs. Final Race Placing\")+\n  xlab(\"Draw\")+\n  ylab(\"Final Placing\")+\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = \"Race Length\"))+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(1,14,by=1))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,14,by=1))\ng3\n\nWarning: `stat(prop)` was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `after_stat(prop)` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the plot above, we can notice a couple things. For one, ALL winners (and even top 2 finishers) in races more than 2000m, started in gates 1 through 7, the inside lanes. This phenomena shows a clear advantage for the inside lanes in longer races. For races less than 1600m, this starting draw seems to not make as much of a difference, however the very outside lanes (lanes 10-14), do show less podium finishes than those horses in more inward lanes. These findings help inform the general relationship between draw and race placment, especially in terms of how we can expect to weight draw when we build models to predict a horse’s racing performance over different track lengths.\n\n\n\nIn order to get an idea of how each race distance in the performance data set is distributed in terms of finishing time (in seconds), I have produced the table down below. This table will set the stage for interpreting the results in subsequent plots.s\n\n# Removing observations where finish time = 0\nperf.no.zero &lt;- perf %&gt;%\n  filter(finish_time != 0)\ntapply(perf.no.zero$finish_time, perf.no.zero$distance, summary)\n\n$`1000`\n   Min. 1st Qu.

The Sha Tin Racecourse contains both dirt and turf tracks, while Happy Valley only contains turf tracks. Analyzing track differences could more optimally predict horse performance for each respective racing grounds. We will take a look at this question in the box plots below.\n\ng4 &lt;- ggplot(perf.no.zero,aes(x=track,y=finish_time,color=as.factor(distance)))+\n  geom_boxplot()+\n  ggtitle(\"Type of Track vs. Finishing Time\")+\n  xlab(\"Type of Track\")+\n  ylab(\"Finishing Time (s)\")+\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = \"Race Length (m)\"))\ng4\n\n\n\n\nUpon first glance, we can see that any race on an AWT track was wither 1200m, 1650m, or 1800m, while races of all distances (where a finishing time was recorded) happened on turf tracks. There does not appear to be any significant difference in median finishing times for the 1200, 1650, and 1800 meter races on AWT tracks versus Turf tracks, which is actually quite suprising. The spread of times on turf tracks, however, does appear to be higher.\nOne can only wonder how the conditions of the tracks might effect finishing time, especially with the influences of weather, seasonality, and how many races the track has already seen before a race. To analyze the effect of track condition, along with the type of track, a grid of plots can be found below.\n\ng5 &lt;- ggplot(perf.no.zero,aes(x=track,y=finish_time,color=race_length))+\n  geom_violin()+\n  ggtitle(\"Type of Track and Track Condition vs. Finishing Time\")+\n  xlab(\"Type of Track\")+\n  ylab(\"Finishing Time (s)\")+\n  facet_wrap(vars(going))+\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = \"Race Length (m)\"))\ng5\n\n\n\n\nAs a reminder, the meanings behind each acronym for ‘going’ can be found below (note that WF means Wet Fast and WS means Wet Slow):  While it may look like there is a lot going on in the above plot, overall, it does not appear that there are any significant differences in median finishing times when turf and AWT tracks have any different going ratings. This finding is VERY suprising. This observation is not to say that track going has NO impact on finishing time, but these differences might be very marginal and require more detailed hypothesis testing and analysis to make further inference. It SHOULD be noted, however, that when an AWT track is rated as fast, good, slow, or wet, there seems to be very little spread in finishing times. In other words, there is far less variability in how fast all the horses run (races might be closer in nature)."

We also have anomalies where ratings are 333 and 951, which we will also remove.\n\nperf&lt;- perf%&gt;%\n  filter(rating &lt; 250 & final_placing != 47 & final_placing != 99)\n\nNow we re-create our plot, along with cleaned formatting.\n\n# Re-ordering factor levels for legend\nperf$race_length &lt;- factor(perf$race_length, levels = c(\"More than 2000m\", \"1600m - 2000m\", \"Less than 1600m\"))\ng1&lt;- ggplot(perf,aes(x=rating,y=final_placing,color=race_length))+\n  geom_point()+\n  ggtitle(\"Horse Rating vs. Final Race Placing\")+\n  xlab(\"Horse Rating\")+\n  ylab(\"Final Placing\")+\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = \"Race Length\"))+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(1,14,by=1))\ng1\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see above, there is a fairly even distribution of placements when we are looking at horse rankings for each race length. This plot helps us understand that historically, horses of all rankings have come in last place, first place, and everywhere in between. We can see, however, that there might be a small pattern happening towards the end of the x-axis: higher ranking horses look like they do not place low frequently and vice versa for lower ranked horses. In order to examine this potential pattern, lets only looking at horses with ranking 125 and up.\n\nperf.rating.filter &lt;- perf %&gt;%\n  filter(rating &gt;= 125)\ng2&lt;- ggplot(perf.rating.filter,aes(x=rating,y=final_placing,color=race_length))+\n  geom_jitter()+\n  ggtitle(\"Horse Rating vs. Final Race Placing\")+\n  xlab(\"Horse Rating\")+\n  ylab(\"Final Placing\")+\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = \"Race Length\"))+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(1,14,by=1))\ng2\n\n\n\n\nHere, we are able to get a better gauge on how rating impacts final placement in a race. We can see that if a horse is above about a 135 rating, it becomes exceedingly rare for them to place below 10th. As we move on to a rating of 140, it becomes rare for the horse to place below 5th. These phenomena apply to races of all lengths (with races between 1600m and 2000m being the most common race). This knowledge becomes helpful when we eventually use horse rating to help determine the probability a horse has a podium finish (placement in the top 3).\nMost horses, however, do not exceed ratings of 130 at the HJKC. Even still, the density of the data points is far higher at better placements for horses between 125 and 130. Horse rating certainly plays a role in determining if it wins (especially since rating is a metric derived from a horse’s past performance and attributes)."

For races less than 1600m, this starting draw seems to not make as much of a difference, however the very outside lanes (lanes 10-14), do show less podium finishes than those horses in more inward lanes. These findings help inform the general relationship between draw and race placment, especially in terms of how we can expect to weight draw when we build models to predict a horse’s racing performance over different track lengths."

The Sha Tin Racecourse contains both dirt and turf tracks, while Happy Valley only contains turf tracks. Analyzing track differences could more optimally predict horse performance for each respective racing grounds. We will take a look at this question in the box plots below.\n\ng4 &lt;- ggplot(perf.no.zero,aes(x=track,y=finish_time,color=as.factor(distance)))+\n  geom_boxplot()+\n  ggtitle(\"Type of Track vs. Finishing Time\")+\n  xlab(\"Type of Track\")+\n  ylab(\"Finishing Time (s)\")+\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = \"Race Length (m)\"))\ng4\n\n\n\n\nUpon first glance, we can see that any race on an AWT track was wither 1200m, 1650m, or 1800m, while races of all distances (where a finishing time was recorded) happened on turf tracks. There does not appear to be any significant difference in median finishing times for the 1200, 1650, and 1800 meter races on AWT tracks versus Turf tracks, which is actually quite suprising. The spread of times on turf tracks, however, does appear to be higher.\nOne can only wonder how the conditions of the tracks might effect finishing time, especially with the influences of weather, seasonality, and how many races the track has already seen before a race. To analyze the effect of track condition, along with the type of track, a grid of plots can be found below.\n\ng5 &lt;- ggplot(perf.no.zero,aes(x=track,y=finish_time,color=race_length))+\n  geom_violin()+\n  ggtitle(\"Type of Track and Track Condition vs. Finishing Time\")+\n  xlab(\"Type of Track\")+\n  ylab(\"Finishing Time (s)\")+\n  facet_wrap(vars(going))+\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = \"Race Length (m)\"))\ng5\n\n\n\n\nAs a reminder, the meanings behind each acronym for ‘going’ can be found below (note that WF means Wet Fast and WS means Wet Slow):  While it may look like there is a lot going on in the above plot, overall, it does not appear that there are any significant differences in median finishing times when turf and AWT tracks have any different going ratings. This finding is VERY suprising. This observation is not to say that track going has NO impact on finishing time, but these differences might be very marginal and require more detailed hypothesis testing and analysis to make further inference. It SHOULD be noted, however, that when an AWT track is rated as fast, good, slow, or wet, there seems to be very little spread in finishing times. In other words, there is far less variability in how fast all the horses run (races might be closer in nature)."

    "text": "In this section, we will explore a variety of decision tree methods for classification, including a Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forests, AdaBoost Models, and Gradient Boosting, specifically XGBoost.\nA Decision Tree Classifier is a machine learning algorithm that recursively partitions the input space into regions, assigning a class label to each region. It begins with the entire dataset at the root node and selects the best feature and threshold to split the data into subsets, optimizing for homogeneity within each subset. This process is repeated at each node, creating a tree structure, until a stopping criterion is met. The resulting leaf nodes represent class labels, and predictions for new instances are made by traversing the tree from the root to an appropriate leaf, following the decision rules based on the feature values. Decision Trees are interpretable and versatile, making them valuable for both classification and regression tasks, though they can be prone to overfitting, which can be addressed through techniques like pruning and ensemble methods.\nA Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes for classification tasks or the average prediction for regression tasks. The “random” in Random Forest comes from introducing randomness both in the data and the features used to construct each individual tree. During training, each tree is built using a bootstrap sample (randomly sampled with replacement) from the original dataset, and at each node of the tree, a random subset of features is considered for the split. This randomness introduces diversity among the trees, preventing overfitting and enhancing the model’s robustness. The final prediction is then determined by aggregating the predictions of all the trees. Random Forests are known for their high accuracy, scalability, and ability to handle complex, high-dimensional datasets, making them a popular choice in various machine learning applications.\nAdaBoost, short for Adaptive Boosting, is an ensemble learning technique designed to improve the performance of weak classifiers and create a strong, accurate classifier. It operates by iteratively training a series of weak classifiers on different weighted versions of the training data, where weights are adjusted to focus on instances that the current classifier misclassifies. In each iteration, the algorithm assigns higher weights to misclassified instances, and the subsequent weak classifier is forced to prioritize the correct classification of these instances. The final prediction is made by combining the individual predictions of all weak classifiers through weighted majority voting. AdaBoost is particularly effective in handling imbalanced datasets and tends to generalize well, producing a robust model that performs well on diverse datasets and various types of weak classifiers.\nXGBoost, or Extreme Gradient Boosting, is a powerful and efficient gradient boosting framework that has gained popularity for its high performance in a variety of machine learning tasks. XGBoost enhances traditional gradient boosting by employing a regularization term in the objective function, which helps prevent overfitting. It is designed for both classification and regression problems and is known for its speed, scalability, and flexibility. XGBoost sequentially builds a series of decision trees, and at each iteration, it minimizes a combined objective function that includes both a loss function and a regularization term. The algorithm also incorporates features like tree pruning and parallel computing, making it computationally efficient. Additionally, XGBoost supports custom loss functions and provides tools for feature importance analysis, making it a versatile and widely used tool in machine learning competitions and real-world applications."

What this means for any decision tree we make is that it will the decision tree might become biased towards the majority class, NOT podium finishing. Any imbalanced class distribution may lead to biased impurity measures, favoring the majority class, leading to overfitting and poor generalization.\nWhile this imbalance raises some concerns, we can mitigate this bias through techniques like class weighting (e.g., adaboost) which penalizes misclassifcations of the minority class more heavily or through ensenmble methods like using Random Forests, which build multiple descions trees and combine predicitions. We will explore such methods in the following sections."

Our primary goal of such a decision tree should be to maximize precision, since in a betting market, we want to maximize the probability that we correctly select a podium finisher.\nIn terms of sensitivity, we also see a drop off after 3 layers. Sensitivity conveys to us our ability to pick podium finishers while taking into account horses we incorrectly said we would not finish on the podium. If we are able to maximize sensitivity, we are able to make sure we are not missing out on any betting opportunities. However, being right in a betting market is more important than missing out on opportunities, so we should still maximize precision\nWe can also look at trying to get a balance between accuracy and F-1 score. F-1 score peaks at 5 layers and accuracy falls off immediately after 1 layer. F-1 score would be a metric worth optimizing if we wanted a model that balances maximizing betting opportunities and being correct in our picks, but again, we really just want to maximize correctly picking podium finishers, so precision should be our main concern. Thus, we are going to pick 3 as our max depth.\nLet’s go ahead and fit our model with our tuned hyperparameter, measure its effectiveness, and finally visualize the tree.\n\nmodel = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3)\nmodel = model.fit(X_train,y_train)\n\nyp_train=model.predict(X_train)\nyp_test=model.predict(X_test)\n\nprint(\"------TRAINING------\")\nconfusion_plot(y_train,yp_train)\nprint(\"------TEST------\")\nconfusion_plot(y_test,yp_test)\n\n------TRAINING------\nAccuracy: 0.7568157033805889\nSpecificity: 0.9912408759124087\nPrecision: 0.7142857142857143\nSensitivity 0.06465517241379311\nNegative Predictive Value: 0.7578125\nF1-score: 0.11857707509881424\n------TEST------\nAccuracy: 0.7309644670050761\nSpecificity: 0.9726027397260274\nPrecision: 0.3333333333333333\nSensitivity 0.0392156862745098\nNegative Predictive Value: 0.743455497382199\nF1-score: 0.07017543859649122\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this decision tree. There are a few things of which to take note. We are maximizing precision, so our F-1 score is BAD. Our Accuracy is fairly solid, showing that we are able to weed out a lot of the non podium finishers fairly well. We are missing out on some betting opportunities by having a low sensitivity, but doing such ensures we are not making a lot of bets on podium finishers that are not. Overall, this decision tree would be a very ineffective predicition model in practice as the precision really could be tuned much more, which we will do in following sections. We will go ahead and visualize our decision tree.\n\nclass_names = y.unique()\n\nfeature_names = [str(col) for col in X.columns]\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(25,20))\ntree.plot_tree(model, \n                feature_names=feature_names,  \n                class_names=[str(class_name) for class_name in class_names],\n                filled=True)\nplt.show()"

past performance. A past performance metric could be created to be a very complex variable that weights a multitude of features such as increases in rating over time, historical placement, finishing time history, etc.. I am going to simply create a variable that is the average placement of the horse up until the race date. I could do average race finishing time, but due to every horse running at different distances, I would have to create a an average finishing time for a horse for each distance up until the race date.

    "text": "In this project, I will be exploring the factors that influence the performance of horses at the Hong Kong Jockey Club’s Happy Valley and Sha Tin racing tracks.\n\n\nHorse racing has long been a tradition in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is one of China’s two special adminstrative regions, along with Macao, that existed as a British Colony from 1841 until its handover to China on July 1, 1997. Macao, Hong Kong’s Portuguese-founded sister state (transfered to China in 1999 (Nations 1999)), is often remarked as the “gambling capital of world” (grossing nearly $5.3 billion USD in gaming/gambling revenue in 2022 (Statista 2022)), but many people overlook Hong Kong’s gaming history and culture. In the 1840s, Great Britain introduced horse racing to the people of Hong Kong, quickly becoming a staple of entertainment, sporting, and high-class social status within the colony.\nIn 1884, the Hong Kong Jockey Club (HKJC) was founded as an amatuer body to promote horse racing within Hong Kong. After existing for almost a century, HKJC evolved into a professional institution in 1971 (Cheung 2019). Even with the handover of the region to China in 1997, HKJC still stands as the only government-granted monopoly for horse racing in Hong Kong. While the handover of the region did cause a brief decline in racing and gaming activity due to poor economic conditions, horse racing in the 21st century has soared at the HJKC. In the 2022-2023 racing season alone, the club achieved a record turnover of HK$305.6 billion ($39.1 billion USD) (HKJC 2022) also donated a record HK$7.3 billion ($930 million) to charity, cementing itself as a top ten charitable foundation in the world. HKJC’s commitment to their community and charitable action make it one of the most uniquely spirited gaming institutions in the entire world.\n\n\n\nHKJC’s horse racing betting market is one that is largely foreign to the legalized sports gaming sphere that was newly introduced to the United States in 2021. With US sportsbooks, like Draftkings, FanDuel, BetMGM, etc., users place their bets on sporting events through the sportsbooks’ betting platforms (website or mobile app) according to odds (also known as “lines”) set by the sportsbooks. These lines are determined (fixed) by the sportbook, and if the user’s bet wins, they are paid according to the odds fixed by the sportsbook. On the contrary, if the user loses, the money wagered by the user entirely goes to the sportsbook. While this is one of the most common way sportsbooks and casinos operate around the world, many horse racing promoters and gaming companies, including HJKC, utilize what is called Pari-Mutuel Betting.\nPari-mutuel betting, unlike fixed odds wagering, is a system where users, instead of betting against the bookmakers, are essentially betting against other bettors. Discussed in the widely renowned 1988 paper titled “Anomalies: Parimutel Betting Markets: Racetracks and Lotteries”, written by world-leading experts in behavioral economics and finance, Richard Thaler and William T. Ziemba (Thaler and Ziemba 1988), pari-mutuel systems are betting systems in which all bets are placed into a pool and then dividends are awared based on the number of bets taken and the total amount wagered, in the case of horse racing, total number of bets and total amount wagered on a horse to win. The bookmaker, HKJC in our case, takes a portion, a “takeout”, from the pool and then pays out winning users proportionally to the amount of bets/total amount wagered on the winning outcome compared to the rest of the field. For this reason, pari-mutel betting is often called “pool betting”.\nPari-mutuel payoffs are determined by three factors (Criscola 2023):\n\nThe amount of money placed on the winning horse or combination of horses\nThe track takeout\nBreakage\n\nTypically you will see horse racing bookmakers take between a 16% and 20% takeout from the pool (a number established internally by the bookmakers). Breakage, desribes the process in which payoffs are rounded down to the nearest dime, a practice that is common in most jurisdictions where horse racing is legal. Looking at a theoretical example of how payouts/odds, takeouts, and breakage work, if 40% of the win pool is wagered on one horse, the wagering public would effectively be saying that the horse in question is a 3:2 proposition. But factor in the track takeout, and that potential payoff would drop to 4:3 (which would display as 1:1, or even money, on your screen). Then breakage could take away up to nine cents per every $2 wagered.\nYou can probably see how pari-mutuel pricing and odds can get pretty complex, pretty quick, especially when one is betting on mulitple horse placements, either in a specific finishing order or in any finishing order. While this topic is certainly intersting, especially with respects to game theory, it is not neccesarily the focus of this project. While the outcomes of this project may lead to exploration in advanced betting systems in a pari-mutuel horse racing market, it is not going to be of major focus throughout the exploration of this project. This section is intended to lay the groundwork for the rationale behind this project and the reasonings behind why this project is specifically concerning itself with horse racing in Hong Kong.\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the pari-mutuel system in which HKJC operates is unique. With HKJC taking a portion of the betting pool for every race, they are guranteed a profit for each race they host, no matter the outcome. This system is different from fixed-odds bookmakers who face the risk of losing money on any given matchup (these bookmakers do intentionally overinflate their odds, adding a “vigorish” to the lines, in order to maximize the attainability of profit, but again, that is out of the scope of this project). Because of this unique characteristic, Hong Kong horse racing can be a widely profitable sport to bet on. This fact is true for two main reasons:\n\nIncreased market ineffciencies due to the biases of the “uninfomred” betting public\nThe robust existence of publicly-available past performance data\n\nThe first point points to the fact that because the odds for each race are essentially being set by the betting public, there leaves room in each of the odds for payouts that are innacurate to the true probability of specific race events/outcomes to occur. In a 2008 paper (originally published in 1994) titled “Computer Based Horse Race Handicapping and Wagering Systems: A Report” written by Bill Benter (Benter 2008) (who is widely considered the most succesful sports handicapper of all time), the author points to the fact that while the public on the whole tends to come pretty close to the true probabilites associated with outcomes in horse racing with their probability estimates (the dispersion of wagers in the betting pool), they do have a slight margin of error that creates slight market ineffciencies. These market ineffciences can be found and exploited with the creation of a computerized handicapping model that seeks to predict horse racing outcomes. It is for this core reason that this project is being pursued. With an exploration of the foundational analytical insights that are attached to horse racing, which will be achieved through this project, an accurate advanced handicapping model becomes one step closer to being realized.\nThe second point highlights the fact that HKJC provides data on every race it has ever hosted on both of its tracks, Happy Valley and Sha Tin (since they started tracking race statistics through computerization). HKJC’s reasoning for providing such data is simply due to the fact that it encourages more people to bet, which in turn allows them to have more of a takeout per pool. American sportsbooks directly profit off their users knowing as little as possible about the events they are betting on, while the contrary is true for HKJC and their horse racing events. Resultantly, HKJC sits on a uniquely rich mountain of data that anyone can use. With publicly-available access to a robust set of data with hundreds of features, it becomes immensely easier and more accesible to not only making an advanced betting model, but also for conducting any analytics in general surrounding horse racing. This fact is another reason why I am choosing to look at Hong Kong horse racing over horse racing anywhere else in the world.\nOn top of these points, there is not a lot of existing publicly-available literature surrounding horse racing in Hong Kong. The literature that does exist is either outdated, or is a largley unprofessional post on blog sites or Git Hub. The lack of literature shows that there is a large gap in research surrounding horse racing in pari-mutuel systems in general, providing further validity to this project.\nAgain, while this project will not directly develop an advanced betting system, it is intended that will it serve as some of the early foundation for such a system. Through findings gleaned from this project, more advanced machine learning technqiues and predictive mathematics may be explored. This project will help open a window of opportunity for a more advanced and focused exploration of horse racing and game theory.\n\n\n\nWith all the above background information, this project intends to explore the following 10 questions:\n\nWhat factors are most important in determining if a horse wins a race?\nDoes a difference in declared weight of a horse versus its actual weight play at all into if the horse wins?\nDoes draw (which gate the horse starts out of) impact a horses’s finishing position. If so, to what extent?\nDo some horses perform better on turf or grass tracks?\nDo certain breeds of horses perform better than others?\nDo past race placments give any insight to future placments?\nDo horses in their “rookie” seasons perform better or worse than the rest of the field?\nHow much do the closing odds determine where a horse finishes?\nHow much does horse “rating” come into play when trying to determine horse performance?\nTo what extent do past length-behind-winner measurements determine horse perfomance?\n\n\n\n\n\nBenter, William. 2008. “Computer Based Horse Race Handicapping and Wagering Systems: A Report.” In Efficiency of Racetrack Betting Markets, 183–98.

This fact is true for two main reasons:\n\nIncreased market ineffciencies due to the biases of the “uninfomred” betting public\nThe robust existence of publicly-available past performance data\n\nThe first point points to the fact that because the odds for each race are essentially being set by the betting public, there leaves room in each of the odds for payouts that are innacurate to the true probability of specific race events/outcomes to occur. In a 2008 paper (originally published in 1994) titled “Computer Based Horse Race Handicapping and Wagering Systems: A Report” written by Bill Benter (Benter 2008) (who is widely considered the most succesful sports handicapper of all time), the author points to the fact that while the public on the whole tends to come pretty close to the true probabilites associated with outcomes in horse racing with their probability estimates (the dispersion of wagers in the betting pool), they do have a slight margin of error that creates slight market ineffciencies. These market ineffciences can be found and exploited with the creation of a computerized handicapping model that seeks to predict horse racing outcomes. It is for this core reason that this project is being pursued. With an exploration of the foundational analytical insights that are attached to horse racing, which will be achieved through this project, an accurate advanced handicapping model becomes one step closer to being realized.\nThe second point highlights the fact that HKJC provides data on every race it has ever hosted on both of its tracks, Happy Valley and Sha Tin (since they started tracking race statistics through computerization). HKJC’s reasoning for providing such data is simply due to the fact that it encourages more people to bet, which in turn allows them to have more of a takeout per pool. American sportsbooks directly profit off their users knowing as little as possible about the events they are betting on, while the contrary is true for HKJC and their horse racing events. Resultantly, HKJC sits on a uniquely rich mountain of data that anyone can use. With publicly-available access to a robust set of data with hundreds of features, it becomes immensely easier and more accesible to not only making an advanced betting model, but also for conducting any analytics in general surrounding horse racing. This fact is another reason why I am choosing to look at Hong Kong horse racing over horse racing anywhere else in the world.\nOn top of these points, there is not a lot of existing publicly-available literature surrounding horse racing in Hong Kong. The literature that does exist is either outdated, or is a largley unprofessional post on blog sites or Git Hub. The lack of literature shows that there is a large gap in research surrounding horse racing in pari-mutuel systems in general, providing further validity to this project.\nAgain, while this project will not directly develop an advanced betting system, it is intended that will it serve as some of the early foundation for such a system. Through findings gleaned from this project, more advanced machine learning technqiues and predictive mathematics may be explored. This project will help open a window of opportunity for a more advanced and focused exploration of horse racing and game theory."

    "text": "With all the above background information, this project intends to explore the following 10 questions:\n\nWhat factors are most important in determining if a horse wins a race?\nDoes a difference in declared weight of a horse versus its actual weight play at all into if the horse wins?\nDoes draw (which gate the horse starts out of) impact a horses’s finishing position. If so, to what extent?\nDo some horses perform better on turf or grass tracks?\nDo certain breeds of horses perform better than others?\nDo past race placments give any insight to future placments?\nDo horses in their “rookie” seasons perform better or worse than the rest of the field?\nHow much do the closing odds determine where a horse finishes?\nHow much does horse “rating” come into play when trying to determine horse performance?\nTo what extent do past length-behind-winner measurements determine horse perfomance?\n\n\n\n\n\nBenter, William. 2008. “Computer Based Horse Race Handicapping and Wagering Systems: A Report.” In Efficiency of Racetrack Betting Markets, 183–98.

This was orginally attempted for this project (for, admittedly, too long of a period of a time), but it requires writing code to solve logic and math games set up by the HJKC. They do not mind people using their data, but they do no want an oversaturation of users using their data. There are many companies that offer up-to-date HJKC data for a monthly subscription, but this is, obviously, not worthwhile for this project. Outside of this paid data and running an extremely complicated API (that is often very sensitive to breaking day-to-day), there is an extremely limited pool of data that is free and easy-to-use.\nUpon scouring the web, I (almost accidentally) stumbled upon a user on GitHub by the username eprochasson who actually used to manage a public, web scraper for Hong Kong and Singapore horse racing. The user has not updated the data obtained from this scraper since 2019, but due to horse racing not really changing as a sport year-to-year (unlike sports like basketball, baseball, etc.), the receny of this data is more than suffcient for this project. The GitHub containing all this data can be found here.\nOn this GitHub site, there are 6 different datasets that can accessed: dividends, horses, live_odds, performances, races, and sectional times. The divideneds and live odds datasets will be not be focused on in this project. Horses and performances will serve as the main sources of data for this project. The data dates backs all the way back to the early 1990s and goes through the middle of 2018. The horses dataset contains information on every horse that is raced in Hong Kong and Singapore, including information about their owners, jockey, its dame and sire (mother and father), and siblings. There are over 20,0000 observations (horses) in this dataset. There are overall 26 features in this dataset.\nA screenshot of the horses csv file (once it is unzipped from the gz file), can be found below: \nThe performances dataset captures every single performance by each of the horses in the horses dataset. Because of this relationship between the datasets, there are almost 400,000 observations in this datset. The datset captures 26 features, including the placement of the horse in the race, its starting draw, and data relating to how it ran all 4 sections of the track.\nA screenshot of the performances csv file (once it is unzipped from the gz file), can be found below: \nAgain, more of a description of the features of all these datasets will be discussed upon further completion of this web page."

For our categorical variables, we will be performing mutliple correspondence analysis (MCA) (see following section). We will be including discrete numerical variables with the caveat that PCA is best and primarily suited for continous, numerical variables. Using discrete data in PCA may pose some problems like violations of distributional assumptions as PCA does not take into to account assumptions of non-normality in the data (see https://staskolenikov.net/talks/Gustavo-Stas-PCA-generic.pdf). Such violations definitely poses an issue with a variable like ‘draw’ in our data which, in theory, follows a uniform distribution. Also, if a variable has high kurtosis or skewness, the variable is going to have different asymptotic properties that could impact our interpretation of our principal components. Due to these different asymptotic properties, the PCA values in our eigenvector values for our discrete features may be much lower than our continous features, even if the discrete features do, in “ground truth”, explain a significant portion of variance in our data.\nThe authors of the paper listed above state that these problems are not major, but do need to be considered when interpreting principal components. The authors do list seperate techniques of dimensionality reduction for discrete features (i.e. Filmer-Pritchett procedure, polychoric PCA, and group means), but for the sake of this project, I will be doing a typical PCA with both my discrete and continous numericals in my feature set, taking into account that the discrete features might have lower PCA values.\n\n# Adding in podium finish as a target variable\nperf_clean['podium'] = np.nan\nfor i in range(len(perf_clean[\"final_placing\"])):   \n    if perf_clean[\"final_placing\"][i] == 1 or perf_clean[\"final_placing\"][i] == 2 or perf_clean[\"final_placing\"][i] == 3:\n        perf_clean['podium'][i] = 1\n    else:\n        perf_clean['podium'][i] = 0\n\n/tmp/ipykernel_355532/3691484775.py:7: SettingWithCopyWarning: \nA value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame\n\nSee the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n  perf_clean['podium'][i] = 0\n/tmp/ipykernel_355532/3691484775.py:5: SettingWithCopyWarning: \nA value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame\n\nSee the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n  perf_clean['podium'][i] = 1\n\n\n\n# All relevant numerical features including\nperf_numerical = perf_clean[['rating','actual_weight','on_date_weight','draw','average_placement','days_between', 'podium']]\nperf_numerical = perf_numerical.dropna()\n\nNow we are going to standardize our data and peform PCA.\n\n# Normalize feature set\nperf_num_features = perf_numerical.iloc[:, :-1]\nscaler = StandardScaler()\nscaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(perf_num_features)\n\n\n# PCA\npca = PCA()\npca.fit(scaled_data)\ncov_matrix = pca.get_covariance()\neigenvectors = pca.components_\neigenvalues = pca.explained_variance_\n\nprint(\"Covariance Matrix:\")\nprint(cov_matrix)\n\nprint(\"\\nEigenvalues:\")\nprint(eigenvalues)\n\nprint(\"\\nEigenvectors:\")\nprint(eigenvectors)\n\n\nCovariance Matrix:\n[[ 1.00000574  0.16812366  0.15552332 -0.02631532 -0.43889779  0.01146646]\n [ 0.16812366  1.00000574  0.04296327  0.00109719 -0.14074245  0.0101492 ]\n [ 0.15552332  0.04296327  1.00000574 -0.00917871 -0.14289013  0.02713919]\n [-0.02631532  0.00109719 -0.00917871  1.00000574  0.01588906  0.00257841]\n [-0.43889779 -0.14074245 -0.14289013  0.01588906  1.00000574 -0.00136074]\n [ 0.01146646  0.0101492   0.02713919  0.00257841 -0.00136074  1.00000574]]\n\nEigenvalues:\n[1.60560626 1.00677582 0.99946662 0.9526173  0.87588313 0.5596853 ]\n\nEigenvectors:\n[[-0.62733661 -0.34080662 -0.33228691  0.04763382  0.61358235 -0.03365643]\n [-0.05315568 -0.01428587  0.21171307  0.41376421  0.06857758  0.88104725]\n [-0.02164703 -0.20350403  0.16461573 -0.88991496  0.04338487  0.37038937]\n [-0.00129095  0.67569924 -0.67056052 -0.17257946  0.03796183  0.25010535]\n [ 0.29344057 -0.61894347 -0.60620044  0.06696241 -0.36899233  0.15060986]\n [ 0.71905884 -0.05071864 -0.02311411  0.01771769  0.69234033 -0.01409562]]\n\n\nAbove, the eigenvector matrix displays our main piece of interest for PCA. Each column represents a principal component, with the first column representing PC1. Each row in the matrix represents the following variables, respectively: ‘rating’,‘actual_weight’,‘on_date_weight’,‘draw’,‘average_placement’,‘days_between’.\nBefore we begin to dissect our PC values, we must define how many PC’s should be of our interest. Using the Kaiser criterion, we should only be considering PC’s with corresponding eigenvalues that are greater than 1. In our case, our third PC is just barely under 1 and the 4th is not too far behind. Therefore, knowing what we know about our inclusion of discrete features, in order to make sure we are not discluding relevant information, we are going to be looking at at least the first 4 PC’s. We can confirm our choice with the Scree Plot down below.\n\nexplained_variance_ratio = pca.explained_variance_ratio_\ncumulative_explained_variance = np.cumsum(explained_variance_ratio)\n\n# Plot the scree plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.bar(range(1, len(explained_variance_ratio) + 1), explained_variance_ratio, alpha=0.75, align='center', label='Individual explained variance')\nplt.step(range(1, len(explained_variance_ratio) + 1), cumulative_explained_variance, where='mid', label='Cumulative explained variance')\nplt.title('Scree Plot')\nplt.xlabel('Principal Components')\nplt.ylabel('Explained Variance Ratio')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nIn this plot, we can see that the first five principal components actually seem to propogate the most explained variance. For this reason, we will include the fifth PC into our analysis as well."

    "text": "Analysis of Principal Components\nLooking at the first principal component, it is clear there are two main features that explain most of the variance in the data: the amount of rest days between a horse’s race and horse rating. Their values in our matrix of eigenvectors are approximately 0.719 and -0.627, repectively, showing they vary inversely. These variables can be considered the most “important” of our numeric feature set.\nIn our second principal component, we can see two features with values of 0.676 and -0.619, respectively: draw and average placement before the race. These features can be seen as our “second most important” features.\nIn our third prinicipal component, draw and average placement also stand out as features, this time posting values of -0.671 and -0.606.\nOur fourth principal component showss on date weight (which does not include the gear a horse is wearing) as a standout feature with a value of -0.890. We can see actual weight, which is the weight of a horse’s gear, showing a value of 0.414 which certainly is somewhat novel, but given that it does not really exceed an “eyeball” test of being above the threshold of 0.5 and on date weight is the main standout feature of this PC, we can likely disregard actual weight.\nOur fifth principal component shows rating (0.614) and days of rest between races (0.692) as the most heavily weighted. We have already seen both of these features as the most heavily weighted in previous PCs so the fifth PC really is not giving us any “new” information.\nUpon this analysis, we can see that we most likely disregard “actual weight” as a feature in our dataset. Dropping this feature will provide some more simplicity to our analyses in future sections. It is interesting to see that the rest of the features explain a significant portion of the variance in our numerical feature set. Most interesting to me is how days of rest between races presented itself as such a significant feature, especially given this is a feature we derived ourselves during data cleaning. Horse rating being such an important feature does make sense as it is sort of a “catch all” metric of past performance by a horse that measures and synthesizes an amalgamation of features relating to a horse’s past race performance.\nBelow is a plot that helps us visualize our dataset compared with our target variable of podium finish.\n\nX1 = pca.fit_transform(scaled_data)\nY = perf_numerical['podium']\n\n#2D PLOT\nplt.scatter(X1[:,0], X1[:,1], c=Y, cmap='Paired')\nplt.xlabel(\"rating\")\nplt.ylabel(\"on date weight\")\nplt.title(\"2D Plot of Numerical Feature Set\")\nplt.show()"

    "text": "Fitting a Final, “Optimal” NB Model\nWe will now use our subset of features to fit a final NB model. Our training model, consisting of the optimal feature set, will take a split of test data from the original dataset in order to give the model “unseen” data with classfication labels we already know, so that we can develop accurate metrics surroudning the performance of our model.\n\nx = np.array(perf_classifier_encode[['sex','draw','rating']])\ny = np.array([perf_classifier_encode['podium']])\ny = y.transpose()\n\n\nimport random\nN=x.shape[0]\nl = [*range(N)]     # indices\ncut = int(0.8 * N) #80% of the list\ncut2 = int((N - cut)/2 + cut)\nrandom.shuffle(l)   # randomize\ntrain_index = l[:cut] # first 80% of shuffled list\nvalidate_index = l[cut:cut2] # 10% of shuffled list\ntest_index = l[cut2:] # 10% of shuffled list\n\n\n(acc_train,acc_test,time_train,time_eval)=train_CNB_model(x,y,i_print=True)\n\n(266164, 3) (266164, 1)\n74.83644936622662 74.76049141526092 0.0715845999998237 0.03521339999997508\n\n\nWe can see above that our model has a test accuracy of 74.83% and has a test accuracy of 74.76% which is fairly strong. Because both our training and test accuracies are very close in magnitude with the test accuracy being slightly larger, we can conclude that our model is definitely not overfit as the test accuracy would be much lower if this were the case. There might be the argument that our model underfits the data because our test accuracy is so close to the train accuracy, and as you will see later, our F-1 score is pretty abysmal. We explore this idea in a little bit.\n\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, ConfusionMatrixDisplay\nfrom sklearn import metrics\nx_train=x[train_index]\ny_train=y[train_index].flatten()\n\nx_test=x[test_index]\ny_test=y[test_index].flatten()\n\nclf = CategoricalNB()\nclf.fit(x_train,y_train)\n\nyp_test = clf.predict(x_test)\ncm = confusion_matrix(y_test, yp_test)\ndisp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix=cm)\ndisp.plot()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nAccuracy = metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, yp_test)\nPrecision = metrics.precision_score(y_test, yp_test)\nSensitivity = metrics.recall_score(y_test, yp_test)\nSpecificity = metrics.recall_score(y_test, yp_test,pos_label=0)\nF1_score = metrics.f1_score(y_test, yp_test)\nprint(\"Accuracy:\",Accuracy*100)\nprint(\"Precision:\", Precision*100)\nprint(\"Sensitivity:\",Sensitivity*100)\nprint(\"Specificity:\",Specificity*100)\nprint(\"F1 Score:\",F1_score*100)\n\nAccuracy: 74.53882856820829\nPrecision: 52.0\nSensitivity: 0.38353739489600236\nSpecificity: 99.8790200625063\nF1 Score: 0.7614584858690876\n\n\nWe can notice a few things. First of all, our model is about 75% accurate which is very strong. At the surface level, our precision is also fairly strong at around 60%. Of the horse podium finishers predicted, our model predicts correctly predicts them as podium finishers 60% of the time. HOWEVER, our confusion matrix shows that our model only predicted 27 out of the over 20,0000 observations as correctly positive podium finishers. We can see in the confusion matrix that the model is REALLY good at predicting non-podium finishers with a specificity of around 99%. This characteristic is not really impressive in practicality, however, as we are really just interested in predicting horse podium finishers. Resultantly, our ability in predicting positive results is very low, with an EXTREMELY low sensitity score. Our F-1 score is also VERY low, showing that this model is overall not very effective at all for predicting horse racing podium finishes. This characteristic is also an indication that our model is very underfitted as we are not capturing all neccessary patterns and behaviors neccessary for correctly prediciting podium finishes."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nOverall, our model is not a great overall tool for predicting horse podium finishers (this might be a little bit of an understatement). What is a valuable takeaway from this exercise, however, is we can very strongly observe what characteristics drive a horse to NOT finsh on the podium. A horse’s attributes like color and import type (which delineate what type of horse we are observing) really do not have any impact on the probability a horse has a podium finish. A horse’s sex (i.e. if it is a colt, philly, mare, adolescent, or adult) can, however, be used to help inform if a horse will likely not finish on the podium. Rating and draw are the most important features here. Our model is able to show us that given a horse’s draw and rating, we can discount its likelihood to finish on the podium if its draw and rating are below a certain threshold. While this threshold is not clearly defined yet, this phenomena does allow us to understand that draw and rating will be important features as we continue to try and predict horse performance with more advanced statistical methods. These findings will be reported in the final conclusive report generated for this project, along with being used as the basis for much of the feature selection as we go forth developing more advanced models in this project."
