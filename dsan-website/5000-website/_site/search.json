Analyzing tweet sentiment is valuable in that it will allow us to look at tweets related to specific races, horses, courses, etc., in order to more succesfully pin down why betting odds are moving the way they are within HKJC’s parimutel betting market. Public betting is the sole factor that goes into the generation of odds on horse racing outcomes, so having a model that is able to analyze public perception surrouning HJKC horse racing will allow us to more succesfully pin down why certain horses are seeing various odds movements and insight to how we should we be making our own decisions behind betting horse winners.\nThis section will be completed using Python."

I will be using all 1000 features of this data set. To reiterate, our original text data has close to 30,000 features, but the computing power neccessary to process all of these tweets is beyond the computing power at which is at my disposal. 1000 features is an optimal choice due to these constraints."

Our model can serve as a strong basis for analyzing tweets pertaining to Hong Kong horse racing and public perception surrounding certain horses. Because horse racing odds in a parimutel betting market are directly reliant upon the betting public, having a model that is able to succesfully classify (most of the time) the sentiment behind any tweet concerning any race, course, or horse, we become even closer to identifying not only all factors relating to what drives the public to bet the way they do, but also quantifying the influence of the betting public. These findings will be reported in the final conclusive report generated from this project, likely alongside the generated model predicting sentiment behind actual HKJC-related tweets."

DBSAN takes into account that data may adhere to clusters of arbitrary shapes or contain noise that impacts the shape of the cluster. DBSCAN is also robust to outliers and does not require us to specify a certain number of clusters. On top of all these advantages, DBSCAN is a computationally fast algorithim, all things considered.\nYou may be asking yourself, with all of these advantages to DBSCAN, why would we consider any other algorithim for clustering? For one, DBSCAN requires drops in density between cluster borders, so if you have datapoints in potential clusters that are fairly overlapping, DBSCAN is going to have a hard time delineating the clusters, probably assigning all the data points to one “mega cluster”. Also, DBSCAN struggles to detect clusters with varying density and also really struggles with high-dimensional data. If you do feel as though there is not a lot of density drop in clusters or significantly irregular density fluctuations in your clusters, DBSCAN should NOT be used. Otherwise, DBSCAN can serve as a formidable technique to dealing with anomalous datapoints and/or non-convex clusters."

A dendrogram is a tree-like visualization that relates all dataspoints in our space. At the bottom of our dendrogram, we have each of our datapoints. As we move up the tree, we see the tree aggregate into clusters. The further we move up the tree, the greater our cluster size/distance is. An example image of a dendrogram can be seen below (the orginal image can be found in the above link).\n\n\n\nDendrogram\n\n\nDendrograms can be derived either through agglomerative clustering or divsive clustering. In agglomerative clustering, data points are first considered as their own subclusters, and then through defining a distance metric (e.g. Euclidean distance), we measure the distance between all of our subclusters and merge the two nearest subclusters, repeating this process until we are left with one cluster, the “top” of the dendrogram.\nIn divisive clustering, we performing a “top down” approach to developing our dendrogram. We iteratively perform the process of k-means on our data, starting from the datset as a whole, all the way until we have k clusters equal to the amount of datapoints in the dataset, or the number of clusters you so desire in your dendrogram.\nHierarchical clustering allows us to create clusters out of very complex shapes of data and also gives us a fairly simple medium of interpretation through the dendrogram. We are able to manually pick the number of clusters that we see as significant, which can be advantageous, but also disadvantegous if our data is complex as interpreting dendrograms is heavily driven by heuristics. This heuristical process allows us serious benefits in interpreation, but does require us to be heavily knowledged about our data."

Unlike K-Means, which operates on numerical features, K-Modes identifies clusters based on the mode (most frequent category) within each cluster. It measures dissimilarity using a matching metric for categorical variables, aiming to minimize the number of mismatches within clusters. The algorithm assigns each data point to the cluster with the most similar categorical profile. Huang’s initialization method is commonly used with K-Modes clustering to initialize centroids effectively. This method starts by randomly selecting a data point as the first centroid and then chooses subsequent centroids based on their dissimilarity to existing ones. Huang’s initialization improves the convergence and performance of K-Modes clustering, particularly when dealing with datasets consisting of categorical features."

The distribution of the data is fairly evenly distributed across race lengths, all things considered. We do not need to treat one of the race length groups as an outlier to the data.\nNow we will start to build visualizations.\n\ng1&lt;- ggplot(perf,aes(x=rating,y=final_placing))+geom_jitter()\ng1\n\nWarning: Removed 7615 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon the initial creation of this plot, we can see that we have some errors in our data where there are final placings of 47 and 99. We are going to delete these points. We also have anomalies where ratings are 333 and 951, which we will also remove.\n\nperf&lt;- perf%&gt;%\n  filter(rating &lt; 250 & final_placing != 47 & final_placing != 99)\n\nNow we re-create our plot, along with cleaned formatting.\n\n# Re-ordering factor levels for legend\nperf$race_length &lt;- factor(perf$race_length, levels = c(\"More than 2000m\", \"1600m - 2000m\", \"Less than 1600m\"))\ng1&lt;- ggplot(perf,aes(x=rating,y=final_placing,color=race_length))+\n  geom_point()+\n  ggtitle(\"Horse Rating vs. Final Race Placing\")+\n  xlab(\"Horse Rating\")+\n  ylab(\"Final Placing\")+\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = \"Race Length\"))+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(1,14,by=1))\ng1\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see above, there is a fairly even distribution of placements when we are looking at horse rankings for each race length. This plot helps us understand that historically, horses of all rankings have come in last place, first place, and everywhere in between. We can see, however, that there might be a small pattern happening towards the end of the x-axis: higher ranking horses look like they do not place low frequently and vice versa for lower ranked horses. In order to examine this potential pattern, lets only looking at horses with ranking 125 and up.\n\nperf.rating.filter &lt;- perf %&gt;%\n  filter(rating &gt;= 125)\ng2&lt;- ggplot(perf.rating.filter,aes(x=rating,y=final_placing,color=race_length))+\n  geom_jitter()+\n  ggtitle(\"Horse Rating vs. Final Race Placing\")+\n  xlab(\"Horse Rating\")+\n  ylab(\"Final Placing\")+\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = \"Race Length\"))+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(1,14,by=1))\ng2\n\n\n\n\nHere, we are able to get a better gauge on how rating impacts final placement in a race. We can see that if a horse is above about a 135 rating, it becomes exceedingly rare for them to place below 10th. As we move on to a rating of 140, it becomes rare for the horse to place below 5th. These phenomena apply to races of all lengths (with races between 1600m and 2000m being the most common race). This knowledge becomes helpful when we eventually use horse rating to help determine the probability a horse has a podium finish (placement in the top 3).\nMost horses, however, do not exceed ratings of 130 at the HJKC. Even still, the density of the data points is far higher at better placements for horses between 125 and 130. Horse rating certainly plays a role in determining if it wins (especially since rating is a metric derived from a horse’s past performance and attributes).\n\n\n\nFor every horse race, horses are given a starting position in the starting gates based on a random draw. There is often debate over what draw is best for a horse given the different lengths of races. I will be creating a plot to explore this debate and visualize how starting draw has affected final race placement among horses at HKJC.\n\ng3&lt;- ggplot(perf.rating.filter,aes(x=draw,y=final_placing,color=race_length))+\n  geom_count(aes(size = stat(prop)))+\n  ggtitle(\"Starting Draw vs. Final Race Placing\")+\n  xlab(\"Draw\")+\n  ylab(\"Final Placing\")+\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = \"Race Length\"))+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(1,14,by=1))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,14,by=1))\ng3\n\nWarning: `stat(prop)` was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `after_stat(prop)` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the plot above, we can notice a couple things. For one, ALL winners (and even top 2 finishers) in races more than 2000m, started in gates 1 through 7, the inside lanes. This phenomena shows a clear advantage for the inside lanes in longer races. For races less than 1600m, this starting draw seems to not make as much of a difference, however the very outside lanes (lanes 10-14), do show less podium finishes than those horses in more inward lanes. These findings help inform the general relationship between draw and race placment, especially in terms of how we can expect to weight draw when we build models to predict a horse’s racing performance over different track lengths.\n\n\n\nIn order to get an idea of how each race distance in the performance data set is distributed in terms of finishing time (in seconds), I have produced the table down below.

The Sha Tin Racecourse contains both dirt and turf tracks, while Happy Valley only contains turf tracks. Analyzing track differences could more optimally predict horse performance for each respective racing grounds.

There does not appear to be any significant difference in median finishing times for the 1200, 1650, and 1800 meter races on AWT tracks versus Turf tracks, which is actually quite suprising. The spread of times on turf tracks, however, does appear to be higher.\nOne can only wonder how the conditions of the tracks might effect finishing time, especially with the influences of weather, seasonality, and how many races the track has already seen before a race. To analyze the effect of track condition, along with the type of track, a grid of plots can be found below.\n\ng5 &lt;- ggplot(perf.no.zero,aes(x=track,y=finish_time,color=race_length))+\n  geom_violin()+\n  ggtitle(\"Type of Track and Track Condition vs. Finishing Time\")+\n  xlab(\"Type of Track\")+\n  ylab(\"Finishing Time (s)\")+\n  facet_wrap(vars(going))+\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = \"Race Length (m)\"))\ng5\n\n\n\n\nAs a reminder, the meanings behind each acronym for ‘going’ can be found below (note that WF means Wet Fast and WS means Wet Slow):  While it may look like there is a lot going on in the above plot, overall, it does not appear that there are any significant differences in median finishing times when turf and AWT tracks have any different going ratings. This finding is VERY suprising. This observation is not to say that track going has NO impact on finishing time, but these differences might be very marginal and require more detailed hypothesis testing and analysis to make further inference. It SHOULD be noted, however, that when an AWT track is rated as fast, good, slow, or wet, there seems to be very little spread in finishing times. In other words, there is far less variability in how fast all the horses run (races might be closer in nature)."

Let's fix this issue.\nperf &lt;- perf %&gt;%\n  filter(average_placement &lt; 15)\n\ng9&lt;-ggplot(perf,aes(x=average_placement, y=final_placing))+\n  geom_count()+\n  ggtitle(\"Average Placement Before Race vs. Final Race Placing\")+\n  xlab(\"Average Placement\")+\n  ylab(\"Final Placing\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(1,14,by=1))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,14,by=1))\n\ng9\n\n\n\n\nWe can see something very compelling this plot: a horse’s average placement before its races appears to be very determinant in what place it will finish in a race. A horse will most likely finish 1st if it has a historic placement within 1 to 7. If a horse historically has finished closer to the middle of the pack, it is most likely to continue to finish in the mid pack. The same inference can be applied to horses with poor placements.\n\nDays of Rest Between Races\n\ng10&lt;-ggplot(perf,aes(x=average_placement, y=days_between))+\n  geom_count()+\n  ggtitle(\"Average Placement Before Race vs. Final Race Placing\")+\n  xlab(\"Days of Rest Between Races\")+\n  ylab(\"Final Placing\")\n\ng10\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that most of our data is between 0 and around 15 days of rest. Let’s just look at data over that interval.\n\nperf_rest &lt;- perf[perf$days_between&lt;=15,]\ng11&lt;-ggplot(perf_rest,aes(x=average_placement, y=days_between))+\n  geom_count()+\n  ggtitle(\"Average Placement Before Race vs. Final Race Placing\")+\n  xlab(\"Days of Rest Between Races\")+\n  ylab(\"Final Placing\")\n\ng11\n\n\n\n\nOne of the largest observations we can take away from this visualization is that horses that are placing on the podium (top 3) are mostly getting at least 4+ days of rest. A well rested horse does not mean that it will win, but if a horse placed highly, it does appear it was likely well rested horses."

For our categorical variables, we will be performing mutliple correspondence analysis (MCA) (see following section). We will be including discrete numerical variables with the caveat that PCA is best and primarily suited for continous, numerical variables. Using discrete data in PCA may pose some problems like violations of distributional assumptions as PCA does not take into to account assumptions of non-normality in the data (see https://staskolenikov.net/talks/Gustavo-Stas-PCA-generic.pdf). Such violations definitely poses an issue with a variable like ‘draw’ in our data which, in theory, follows a uniform distribution. Also, if a variable has high kurtosis or skewness, the variable is going to have different asymptotic properties that could impact our interpretation of our principal components. Due to these different asymptotic properties, the PCA values in our eigenvector values for our discrete features may be much lower than our continous features, even if the discrete features do, in “ground truth”, explain a significant portion of variance in our data.\nThe authors of the paper listed above state that these problems are not major, but do need to be considered when interpreting principal components. The authors do list seperate techniques of dimensionality reduction for discrete features (i.e. Filmer-Pritchett procedure, polychoric PCA, and group means), but for the sake of this project, I will be doing a typical PCA with both my discrete and continous numericals in my feature set, taking into account that the discrete features might have lower PCA values.\n\n# Adding in podium finish as a target variable\nperf_clean['podium'] = np.nan\nfor i in range(len(perf_clean[\"final_placing\"])):   \n    if perf_clean[\"final_placing\"][i] == 1 or perf_clean[\"final_placing\"][i] == 2 or perf_clean[\"final_placing\"][i] == 3:\n        perf_clean['podium'][i] = 1\n    else:\n        perf_clean['podium'][i] = 0\n\n/tmp/ipykernel_355532/3691484775.py:7: SettingWithCopyWarning: \nA value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame\n\nSee the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n  perf_clean['podium'][i] = 0\n/tmp/ipykernel_355532/3691484775.py:5: SettingWithCopyWarning: \nA value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame\n\nSee the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n  perf_clean['podium'][i] = 1\n\n\n\n# All relevant numerical features including\nperf_numerical = perf_clean[['rating','actual_weight','on_date_weight','draw','average_placement','days_between', 'podium']]\nperf_numerical = perf_numerical.dropna()\n\nNow we are going to standardize our data and peform PCA.\n\n# Normalize feature set\nperf_num_features = perf_numerical.iloc[:, :-1]\nscaler = StandardScaler()\nscaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(perf_num_features)\n\n\n# PCA\npca = PCA()\npca.fit(scaled_data)\ncov_matrix = pca.get_covariance()\neigenvectors = pca.components_\neigenvalues = pca.explained_variance_\n\nprint(\"Covariance Matrix:\")\nprint(cov_matrix)\n\nprint(\"\\nEigenvalues:\")\nprint(eigenvalues)\n\nprint(\"\\nEigenvectors:\")\nprint(eigenvectors)\n\n\nCovariance Matrix:\n[[ 1.00000574  0.16812366  0.15552332 -0.02631532 -0.43889779  0.01146646]\n [ 0.16812366  1.00000574  0.04296327  0.00109719 -0.14074245  0.0101492 ]\n [ 0.15552332  0.04296327  1.00000574 -0.00917871 -0.14289013  0.02713919]\n [-0.02631532  0.00109719 -0.00917871  1.00000574  0.01588906  0.00257841]\n [-0.43889779 -0.14074245 -0.14289013  0.01588906  1.00000574 -0.00136074]\n [ 0.01146646  0.0101492   0.02713919  0.00257841 -0.00136074  1.00000574]]\n\nEigenvalues:\n[1.60560626 1.00677582 0.99946662 0.9526173  0.87588313 0.5596853 ]\n\nEigenvectors:\n[[-0.62733661 -0.34080662 -0.33228691  0.04763382  0.61358235 -0.03365643]\n [-0.05315568 -0.01428587  0.21171307  0.41376421  0.06857758  0.88104725]\n [-0.02164703 -0.20350403  0.16461573 -0.88991496  0.04338487  0.37038937]\n [-0.00129095  0.67569924 -0.67056052 -0.17257946  0.03796183  0.25010535]\n [ 0.29344057 -0.61894347 -0.60620044  0.06696241 -0.36899233  0.15060986]\n [ 0.71905884 -0.05071864 -0.02311411  0.01771769  0.69234033 -0.01409562]]\n\n\nAbove, the eigenvector matrix displays our main piece of interest for PCA. Each column represents a principal component, with the first column representing PC1. Each row in the matrix represents the following variables, respectively: ‘rating’,‘actual_weight’,‘on_date_weight’,‘draw’,‘average_placement’,‘days_between’.\nBefore we begin to dissect our PC values, we must define how many PC’s should be of our interest. Using the Kaiser criterion, we should only be considering PC’s with corresponding eigenvalues that are greater than 1. In our case, our third PC is just barely under 1 and the 4th is not too far behind. Therefore, knowing what we know about our inclusion of discrete features, in order to make sure we are not discluding relevant information, we are going to be looking at at least the first 4 PC’s. We can confirm our choice with the Scree Plot down below.\n\nexplained_variance_ratio = pca.explained_variance_ratio_\ncumulative_explained_variance = np.cumsum(explained_variance_ratio)\n\n# Plot the scree plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.bar(range(1, len(explained_variance_ratio) + 1), explained_variance_ratio, alpha=0.75, align='center', label='Individual explained variance')\nplt.step(range(1, len(explained_variance_ratio) + 1), cumulative_explained_variance, where='mid', label='Cumulative explained variance')\nplt.title('Scree Plot')\nplt.xlabel('Principal Components')\nplt.ylabel('Explained Variance Ratio')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nIn this plot, we can see that the first five principal components actually seem to propogate the most explained variance. For this reason, we will include the fifth PC into our analysis as well."

    "section": "Analysis of Principal Components",
    "text": "Analysis of Principal Components\nLooking at the first principal component, it is clear there are two main features that explain most of the variance in the data: the amount of rest days between a horse’s race and horse rating. Their values in our matrix of eigenvectors are approximately 0.719 and -0.627, repectively, showing they vary inversely. These variables can be considered the most “important” of our numeric feature set.\nIn our second principal component, we can see two features with values of 0.676 and -0.619, respectively: draw and average placement before the race. These features can be seen as our “second most important” features.\nIn our third prinicipal component, draw and average placement also stand out as features, this time posting values of -0.671 and -0.606.\nOur fourth principal component showss on date weight (which does not include the gear a horse is wearing) as a standout feature with a value of -0.890. We can see actual weight, which is the weight of a horse’s gear, showing a value of 0.414 which certainly is somewhat novel, but given that it does not really exceed an “eyeball” test of being above the threshold of 0.5 and on date weight is the main standout feature of this PC, we can likely disregard actual weight.\nOur fifth principal component shows rating (0.614) and days of rest between races (0.692) as the most heavily weighted. We have already seen both of these features as the most heavily weighted in previous PCs so the fifth PC really is not giving us any “new” information.\nUpon this analysis, we can see that we most likely disregard “actual weight” as a feature in our dataset. Dropping this feature will provide some more simplicity to our analyses in future sections. It is interesting to see that the rest of the features explain a significant portion of the variance in our numerical feature set. Most interesting to me is how days of rest between races presented itself as such a significant feature, especially given this is a feature we derived ourselves during data cleaning. Horse rating being such an important feature does make sense as it is sort of a “catch all” metric of past performance by a horse that measures and synthesizes an amalgamation of features relating to a horse’s past race performance.\nBelow is a plot that helps us visualize our dataset compared with our target variable of podium finish.\n\nX1 = pca.fit_transform(scaled_data)\nY = perf_numerical['podium']\n\n#2D PLOT\nplt.scatter(X1[:,0], X1[:,1], c=Y, cmap='Paired')\nplt.xlabel(\"rating\")\nplt.ylabel(\"on date weight\")\nplt.title(\"2D Plot of Numerical Feature Set\")\nplt.show()"

past performance. A past performance metric could be created to be a very complex variable that weights a multitude of features such as increases in rating over time, historical placement, finishing time history, etc.. I am going to simply create a variable that is the average placement of the horse up until the race date. I could do average race finishing time, but due to every horse running at different distances, I would have to create a an average finishing time for a horse for each distance up until the race date.

    "text": "In this project, I will be exploring the factors that influence the performance of horses at the Hong Kong Jockey Club’s Happy Valley and Sha Tin racing tracks.\n\n\nHorse racing has long been a tradition in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is one of China’s two special adminstrative regions, along with Macao, that existed as a British Colony from 1841 until its handover to China on July 1, 1997. Macao, Hong Kong’s Portuguese-founded sister state (transfered to China in 1999 (Nations 1999)), is often remarked as the “gambling capital of world” (grossing nearly $5.3 billion USD in gaming/gambling revenue in 2022 (Statista 2022)), but many people overlook Hong Kong’s gaming history and culture. In the 1840s, Great Britain introduced horse racing to the people of Hong Kong, quickly becoming a staple of entertainment, sporting, and high-class social status within the colony.\nIn 1884, the Hong Kong Jockey Club (HKJC) was founded as an amatuer body to promote horse racing within Hong Kong. After existing for almost a century, HKJC evolved into a professional institution in 1971 (Cheung 2019). Even with the handover of the region to China in 1997, HKJC still stands as the only government-granted monopoly for horse racing in Hong Kong. While the handover of the region did cause a brief decline in racing and gaming activity due to poor economic conditions, horse racing in the 21st century has soared at the HJKC. In the 2022-2023 racing season alone, the club achieved a record turnover of HK$305.6 billion ($39.1 billion USD) (HKJC 2022) also donated a record HK$7.3 billion ($930 million) to charity, cementing itself as a top ten charitable foundation in the world. HKJC’s commitment to their community and charitable action make it one of the most uniquely spirited gaming institutions in the entire world.\n\n\n\nHKJC’s horse racing betting market is one that is largely foreign to the legalized sports gaming sphere that was newly introduced to the United States in 2021. With US sportsbooks, like Draftkings, FanDuel, BetMGM, etc., users place their bets on sporting events through the sportsbooks’ betting platforms (website or mobile app) according to odds (also known as “lines”) set by the sportsbooks. These lines are determined (fixed) by the sportbook, and if the user’s bet wins, they are paid according to the odds fixed by the sportsbook. On the contrary, if the user loses, the money wagered by the user entirely goes to the sportsbook. While this is one of the most common way sportsbooks and casinos operate around the world, many horse racing promoters and gaming companies, including HJKC, utilize what is called Pari-Mutuel Betting.\nPari-mutuel betting, unlike fixed odds wagering, is a system where users, instead of betting against the bookmakers, are essentially betting against other bettors. Discussed in the widely renowned 1988 paper titled “Anomalies: Parimutel Betting Markets: Racetracks and Lotteries”, written by world-leading experts in behavioral economics and finance, Richard Thaler and William T. Ziemba (Thaler and Ziemba 1988), pari-mutuel systems are betting systems in which all bets are placed into a pool and then dividends are awared based on the number of bets taken and the total amount wagered, in the case of horse racing, total number of bets and total amount wagered on a horse to win. The bookmaker, HKJC in our case, takes a portion, a “takeout”, from the pool and then pays out winning users proportionally to the amount of bets/total amount wagered on the winning outcome compared to the rest of the field. For this reason, pari-mutel betting is often called “pool betting”.\nPari-mutuel payoffs are determined by three factors (Criscola 2023):\n\nThe amount of money placed on the winning horse or combination of horses\nThe track takeout\nBreakage\n\nTypically you will see horse racing bookmakers take between a 16% and 20% takeout from the pool (a number established internally by the bookmakers). Breakage, describes the process in which payoffs are rounded down to the nearest dime, a practice that is common in most jurisdictions where horse racing is legal. Looking at a theoretical example of how payouts/odds, takeouts, and breakage work, if 40% of the win pool is wagered on one horse, the wagering public would effectively be saying that the horse in question is a 3:2 proposition. But factor in the track takeout, and that potential payoff would drop to 4:3 (which would display as 1:1, or even money, on your screen). Then breakage could take away up to nine cents per every $2 wagered.\nYou can probably see how pari-mutuel pricing and odds can get pretty complex, pretty quick, especially when one is betting on mulitple horse placements, either in a specific finishing order or in any finishing order. While this topic is certainly intersting, especially with respects to game theory, it is not neccesarily the focus of this project. While the outcomes of this project may lead to exploration in advanced betting systems in a pari-mutuel horse racing market, it is not going to be of major focus throughout the exploration of this project. This section is intended to lay the groundwork for the rationale behind this project and the reasonings behind why this project is specifically concerning itself with horse racing in Hong Kong.\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the pari-mutuel system in which HKJC operates is unique. With HKJC taking a portion of the betting pool for every race, they are guranteed a profit for each race they host, no matter the outcome. This system is different from fixed-odds bookmakers who face the risk of losing money on any given matchup (these bookmakers do intentionally overinflate their odds, adding a “vigorish” to the lines, in order to maximize the attainability of profit, but again, that is out of the scope of this project). Because of this unique characteristic, Hong Kong horse racing can be a widely profitable sport to bet on. This fact is true for two main reasons:\n\nIncreased market ineffciencies due to the biases of the “uninfomred” betting public\nThe robust existence of publicly-available past performance data\n\nThe first point points to the fact that because the odds for each race are essentially being set by the betting public, there leaves room in each of the odds for payouts that are innacurate to the true probability of specific race events/outcomes to occur. In a 2008 paper (originally published in 1994) titled “Computer Based Horse Race Handicapping and Wagering Systems: A Report” written by Bill Benter (Benter 2008) (who is widely considered the most succesful sports handicapper of all time), the author points to the fact that while the public on the whole tends to come pretty close to the true probabilites associated with outcomes in horse racing with their probability estimates (the dispersion of wagers in the betting pool), they do have a slight margin of error that creates slight market ineffciencies. These market ineffciences can be found and exploited with the creation of a computerized handicapping model that seeks to predict horse racing outcomes. It is for this core reason that this project is being pursued. With an exploration of the foundational analytical insights that are attached to horse racing, which will be achieved through this project, an accurate advanced handicapping model becomes one step closer to being realized.\nThe second point highlights the fact that HKJC provides data on every race it has ever hosted on both of its tracks, Happy Valley and Sha Tin (since they started tracking race statistics through computerization). HKJC’s reasoning for providing such data is simply due to the fact that it encourages more people to bet, which in turn allows them to have more of a takeout per pool. American sportsbooks directly profit off their users knowing as little as possible about the events they are betting on, while the contrary is true for HKJC and their horse racing events. Resultantly, HKJC sits on a uniquely rich mountain of data that anyone can use. With publicly-available access to a robust set of data with hundreds of features, it becomes immensely easier and more accesible to not only making an advanced betting model, but also for conducting any analytics in general surrounding horse racing. This fact is another reason why I am choosing to look at Hong Kong horse racing over horse racing anywhere else in the world.\nOn top of these points, there is not a lot of existing publicly-available literature surrounding horse racing in Hong Kong. The literature that does exist is either outdated, or is a largley unprofessional post on blog sites or Git Hub. The lack of literature shows that there is a large gap in research surrounding horse racing in pari-mutuel systems in general, providing further validity to this project.\nAgain, while this project will not directly develop an advanced betting system, it is intended that will it serve as some of the early foundation for such a system. Through findings gleaned from this project, more advanced machine learning technqiues and predictive mathematics may be explored. This project will help open a window of opportunity for a more advanced and focused exploration of horse racing and game theory.\n\n\n\nWith all the above background information, this project intends to explore the following 10 questions:\n\nWhat factors are most important in determining if a horse wins a race?\nDoes a difference in declared weight of a horse versus its actual weight play at all into if the horse wins?\nDoes draw (which gate the horse starts out of) impact a horses’s finishing position. If so, to what extent?\nDo some horses perform better on turf or grass tracks?\nDo certain breeds of horses perform better than others?\nDo past race placments give any insight to future placments?\nDoes a horse’s rest between races have an impact on their racing performance?\nAre certain horses sexes preffered over others?\nCan we predict if a horse will finish on the podium (top 3 finish)?\n\n\n\n\n\nBenter, William. 2008. “Computer Based Horse Race Handicapping and Wagering Systems: A Report.” In Efficiency of Racetrack Betting Markets, 183–98.

In a 2008 paper (originally published in 1994) titled “Computer Based Horse Race Handicapping and Wagering Systems: A Report” written by Bill Benter (Benter 2008) (who is widely considered the most succesful sports handicapper of all time), the author points to the fact that while the public on the whole tends to come pretty close to the true probabilites associated with outcomes in horse racing with their probability estimates (the dispersion of wagers in the betting pool), they do have a slight margin of error that creates slight market ineffciencies. These market ineffciences can be found and exploited with the creation of a computerized handicapping model that seeks to predict horse racing outcomes. It is for this core reason that this project is being pursued. With an exploration of the foundational analytical insights that are attached to horse racing, which will be achieved through this project, an accurate advanced handicapping model becomes one step closer to being realized.\nThe second point highlights the fact that HKJC provides data on every race it has ever hosted on both of its tracks, Happy Valley and Sha Tin (since they started tracking race statistics through computerization). HKJC’s reasoning for providing such data is simply due to the fact that it encourages more people to bet, which in turn allows them to have more of a takeout per pool. American sportsbooks directly profit off their users knowing as little as possible about the events they are betting on, while the contrary is true for HKJC and their horse racing events. Resultantly, HKJC sits on a uniquely rich mountain of data that anyone can use. With publicly-available access to a robust set of data with hundreds of features, it becomes immensely easier and more accesible to not only making an advanced betting model, but also for conducting any analytics in general surrounding horse racing. This fact is another reason why I am choosing to look at Hong Kong horse racing over horse racing anywhere else in the world.\nOn top of these points, there is not a lot of existing publicly-available literature surrounding horse racing in Hong Kong. The literature that does exist is either outdated, or is a largley unprofessional post on blog sites or Git Hub. The lack of literature shows that there is a large gap in research surrounding horse racing in pari-mutuel systems in general, providing further validity to this project.\nAgain, while this project will not directly develop an advanced betting system, it is intended that will it serve as some of the early foundation for such a system. Through findings gleaned from this project, more advanced machine learning technqiues and predictive mathematics may be explored. This project will help open a window of opportunity for a more advanced and focused exploration of horse racing and game theory."

If so, to what extent?\nDo some horses perform better on turf or grass tracks?\nDo certain breeds of horses perform better than others?\nDo past race placments give any insight to future placments?\nDoes a horse’s rest between races have an impact on their racing performance?\nAre certain horses sexes preffered over others?\nCan we predict if a horse will finish on the podium (top 3 finish)?\n\n\n\n\n\nBenter, William. 2008. “Computer Based Horse Race Handicapping and Wagering Systems: A Report.” In Efficiency of Racetrack Betting Markets, 183–98.

    "text": "For this project I will be using 3 primary data sources: HJKC data found via GitHub, Tweet Sentiment data found via GitHub, and Tweets relating to HKJC’s most recent horse of the year, Golden Sixty.\nThe first data source, raw HJKC data from 1979 to 2018 found on GitHub, will serve as the primary source of our analysis. This data source will be used to compile data on individual horses and races in order to try and see if we can pin down what features most heavily play into racing performance and if we can make worthwhile predictions for races.\nThe second data source, Twitter Sentiment data, was found with the intentions of creating a text classfication model that is able to label the sentiment of a tweet as positive, negative, or neutral. This classficiation model will be made with the intentions of being able to measure the sentiment on Twitter surrounding particular horses, races, and/or events in the HJKC.\nThe third data source, tweets relating to HKJC’s most recent horse of the year, Golden Sixty, is pulled from Twitter’s API which I had to pay for (Thanks, Elon). I will touch more on that later in this section.\n\nHKJC Horses and Performance Data\nWhile the HKJC offers publicly available data, it is immensely hard to scrape off the web. This web scraping was orginally attempted for this project (for, admittedly, too long of a period of a time), but it requires writing code to solve logic and math games set up by the HJKC which change with time. They do not mind people using their data, but they do no want an oversaturation of users using their data. There are many companies that offer up-to-date HJKC data for a monthly subscription, but this is, obviously, not worthwhile for this project. Outside of this paid data and running an extremely complicated API (that is often very sensitive to breaking day-to-day), there is an extremely limited pool of data that is free and easy-to-use. For reference as to how complex the API for HKJC data is, see a past project completed by GitHub user Christy-Lo. This exact API is the only publicly available code for an HJKC API that could be found on the internet, and even if one follows the code line-by-line, HKJC’s logic and math games have changed, so this API code is ony somewhat salvageable. Again, I figured such coding to be out of the scope of this project.\nUpon scouring the web, I (almost accidentally) stumbled upon a user on GitHub by the username eprochasson who actually used to manage a public, web scraper for Hong Kong and Singapore horse racing. The user has not updated the data obtained from this scraper since 2019, but due to horse racing not really changing as a sport year-to-year (unlike sports like basketball, baseball, etc.), the receny of this data is more than suffcient for this project. The GitHub containing all this data can, once again, be found here.\nOn this GitHub site, there are 6 different datasets that can accessed: dividends, horses, live_odds, performances, races, and sectional times. The divideneds and live odds datasets will be not be focused on in this project. Horses and performances will serve as the main sources of data for this project. The data dates backs all the way back to 1979 and goes up until 2018-06-27. The horses dataset contains information on every horse that is raced in Hong Kong and Singapore, including information about their owners, jockey, its dame and sire (mother and father), and siblings. There are over 20,0000 observations (horses) in this dataset. There are overall 26 features in this dataset.\nA screenshot of the horses csv file (once it is unzipped from the gz file), can be found below: \nThe performances dataset captures every single performance by each of the horses in the horses dataset (with each row representing a horse’s performance in a race). Because of this relationship between the datasets, there are almost 400,000 observations in this datset. The datset captures 26 features, including horse attributes, the placement of the horse in the race, its starting draw, race distance/conditions, and data relating to how it ran all 4 sections of the track.\nA screenshot of the performances csv file (once it is unzipped from the gz file), can be found below: \nAs we proceed through analyses in subsequent sections, as we begin to explore all the various features of these datasets, more descriptive explanations of the features will be provided on an as-needed basis.\n\n\nTwitter Data for Sentiment Analysis\nI found a solid labeled dataset for tweets on Kaggle that contains over 27,000 tweets with a sentiment label that either reads “positive”, “negative”, or “neutral”.\nA screenshot of the csv file can be found below. \n\n\nTweets relating to HKJC’s most recent horse of the year, Golden Sixty\nUsing the Twitter API, I was able to pull in the data of 100 tweets relating to the HKJC horse, Golden Sixty (that is the limit with the API developer plan I bought). It is my intention to this text data as additional unseen data for sentiment classifier. I did not want to just create a tweet sentiment analysis classifier for no reason; I wanted to be able to show that there is indeed applicability of tweet classification to this topic area.\nNow, the reason I went out of my way to buy the API (as the free version does not let you pull in tweets anymore due to recent policy changes by Mr. Musk at Twitter cough sorry, X.) was that I was not able to incorporate an R API into this project due to the computational limitations of solving the logic games set up by HKJC. I wanted to especially show that I did not include an R API out of laziness or nonchalance towards this project, but really because it is geniunely hard to get that API set up. This Twitter API was really the only other API I could think of that would have applicability to this project. I had orginally tried sentiment analysis of the news, but I ran into trouble with that, especially due to the lack of accessibility to HJKC news not on Twitter. I shelled out some money to get this API up and going to show my commitmment to this project.\n\n\nNext Steps\nNext steps after collecting this data will be to be clean this data for the analyses that are completed under this project."

    "text": "This section is probably the most substantial and important to the questions asked under this project. We will be attempting to finally make predictions for horse racing, measure how accurate we are, and create the early workings of a more advanced betting system.\nFor this analysis, we will be attempting to maximize the precision of our classifiers in predicting correct horse racing podium finishers. The preference for maximizing precision over other model evaluation metrics stems from the focus on accurately predicting the horse podium finishers. Precision provides insight into the percentage of correctly predicted podium finishers among all the instances predicted as such. In the context of betting, where correctness is financially impactful, accuracy and negative predictive value become less relevant, as they assess the model’s performance on predicting horses that do not finish on the podium. Sensitivity (recall) is insightful as it quantifies the proportion of correctly predicted podium finishers out of the total pool, highlighting potential betting opportunities. However, for this analysis, the emphasis is placed on the accuracy of predictions rather than maximizing betting opportunities. Hence, precision serves as the primary metric of interest for evaluating all models.\nThis section is done with Python."

Unfortunately, while while our tuning process worked out really well with our validation dataset, it performed very poorly on our test set with a precision of around 28%. Such phenomena might be a sign we are overfitting our model to our training data. This overfitting can easily be a symptom of having an imbalanced dataset. Let’s re-try this process, but this time, performing random oversampling in order to combat the imbalance of classes in our dataset.\n\nfrom imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE\n\n# Assuming X_train, y_train are your training data\noversampler = SMOTE(sampling_strategy='auto', random_state=100)\nX_train_resampled, y_train_resampled = oversampler.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)\n\n\nyp_train = best_ada_classifier.predict(X_train_resampled)\nyp_test = best_ada_classifier.predict(X_test)\n\nyp_train = best_ada_classifier.predict(X_train_resampled)\nyp_test = best_ada_classifier.predict(X_test)\n\nprint(\"------TRAINING------\")\nconfusion_plot(y_train_resampled,yp_train)\n\nprint(\"------TEST------\")\nconfusion_plot(y_test,yp_test)\n\n------TRAINING------\nAccuracy: 0.754014598540146\nSpecificity: 0.708029197080292\nPrecision: 0.732620320855615\nSensitivity 0.8\nNegative Predictive Value: 0.7797427652733119\nF1-score: 0.7648290300069784\n------TEST------\nAccuracy: 0.649746192893401\nSpecificity: 0.6575342465753424\nPrecision: 0.3902439024390244\nSensitivity 0.6274509803921569\nNegative Predictive Value: 0.8347826086956521\nF1-score: 0.4812030075187971\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith oversampling, we do get a massive 10% boost in precision to our tuned AdaBoost model.

    "text": "Over this course of this project, we have identified some of the key variables and relationships that explain how horses at the Hong Kong Jockey Club (HKJC) perform in a given race. We created data visualizations under the Data Exploration section that uncovered some suprising truths about horse racing, including that the weight of a horse, nor any added weight, has too much of a bearing on a horse’s race performance, a contradiction to popular tropes in the horse racing betting community. We also uncovered phenomena like that there is a clear advantage for the inside lanes in longer races and that horses rated above certain thresholds (125 and above) almost always place higher. Also, a track’s surface and condition appear to play way less of a factor in a horse’s performance than orginally thought. It is through these findings that we were able to more clearly understand what drives a horse to be successful at the race track.\nUnder our Naive Bayes section, we created a Multinomial Classifier that uses a horse’s attributes like sex, color, and import type, along with discrete features like rating, draw, and days of rest, to predict if a horse will have a podium finish. Our classier has precision (our primary metric of interest) of around 35%, compared to a random classifier which has a precision around 25%. We also created a text classifier that is able to classify the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of tweets with an almost 67% accuracy. We used our trained tweet sentiment classifier to help us classify tweets relating to HKJC’s reigning horse of the year, Golden Sixty.\nWe also conducted an exploration of dimensionality in our data set, first peforming a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of our numerical features in order to figure out which features explain most of the variation in our data. Horse rating and days of rest between races came out to be the most significant of our variables with draw and average placement being our next most “important” variables, with the rest of the variables, except for actual weight, also showing some sort of significant explanation of the variance in the feature set. We used this information to come up with an “optimal” numerical feature set for our sections’ analyses. Also in our exploration of dimensionality, we peformed a T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) analysis which helped us visualize our high dimensional data in a 2-D plane.\nAfter our dimensionality exploration, we ventured into clustering. We performed 4 different clustering techniques: 3 for our numerical feature set found in the dimesnionality section, k-means, and DBSCAN, and Hierarchical clustering, and 1 for our categorical feature set, k-modes. K-modes clustering proved to not be very helpful, giving us 5 clusters with a hardy intrepretable structure. Our numerical clustering showed us that k-means was our most insightful algorithim, giving us 3 clusters of data which can explained as groups of horses that perform well, horses that perform somewhere toward the middle of the road, and horses that perform poorly. Clustering served as a valuable technique to look at groupings in our data that are not given to us.\nLast, but not least, we created a wide variety of tree-based classifiers in our Decision Tree section which served as the most substantial section of this project. Through the creation of a variety of decision trees, random forests, adaptive boosted models, gradient boosting techqniues, and combinations of all these methods, we were able to create a classifier (an AdaBoost classifier with a Random Forest as the base estimator) that is able to pick horse racing podium finishers at the 1200m distance, under a specific set of race conditions, with 50% precision. While 50% precision might not sound all that great on the surface, it actually is extremely valuable, as it allow us ample room to make positive expected value (EV) bets in a parimutel betting market, a mathemathically sure technique for making betting profits.\nIt was discussed that the model we created was only created for one distance under a specific set of racing conditions, so in order for a comprehensive predictive model/betting system, a model would have to be fit at every race distance for ALL race conditions which amounts to hundreds upon hundreds of possible combinations. Our model we generated took over 40 minutes of runtime to create, so creating such a comprehensive predictive system would be VERY computationally expensive. However, it is with our model that we have laid the groundwork for the the future realization of such an advanced system.\nWhile this project does not give us a “ready-to-go” betting system for the HKJC’s betting market, we still now understand some of the main variables, patterns, and interactions that drive horse racing performance at the Hong Kong tracks, and we also have the foundation of a more advanced predictive/betting system. I am going to continue working on creating a more comprehensive betting system for Hong Kong horses, beyond this class project, exploring more advanced algorithims and working to gather more relevant data. This project, overall, encompasses one of my greatest passions of sports handicapping and served as a tremendous learning opportunity for me as I begin my journey deeper into algorithimic betting.\nFor any questions, comments, or suggestions, I can be contacted at msc301@georgetown.edu"

    "title": "Classification of Podium Finishing at HKJC using Multinomial Naive Bayes",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In this section, we will be generating a Multinomial Naive Bayes Model that attempts to predict whether a horse finishes on the podium (1st place, 2nd place, or 3rd place) in any given race. Predicting podium finishes makes up a giant portion of any horse racing betting market and the HKJC betting market is no exception. For this analysis, conducted using Python, we are going to be looking at how we can we use some categorical/discrete numerical variables in our dataset as determinants of podium finishing. As discussed in the Naive Bayes Intro section, Naive Bayes has a Multinomial Classifier algorithim that is suited for handling a feature set that is all discrete, numerical variables. We are going to be “dummy coding” our categorical variables as discrete, numerical variables in order to apply the Multinomial NB algorithim (see this Stack Exchange link for more information on why we are able to dummy code our categorical variables and still use Multinomial NB). It is through this analysis that we will be able to see if a horse’s attributes like sex, color, and import type and also naturally discrete variables like draw, rating, and days of rest are able to succesfully classify podium finishers.\nThis section will be completed using Python.\n\nData Preparation\nWe will begin this analysis by prepping and formatting our data, so that it may be properly read by our algorithim.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport scipy\nimport sklearn \nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\n# Reading in our data\nhorses = pd.read_csv('../../../data/01-modified-data/horses.clean.csv')\nperf = pd.read_csv('../../../data/01-modified-data/perf.clean.no.error.csv')\n\n/tmp/ipykernel_153880/915142976.py:3: DtypeWarning: Columns (10,18,25,26,27,28,29,30) have mixed types. Specify dtype option on import or set low_memory=False.\n  perf = pd.read_csv('../../../data/01-modified-data/perf.clean.no.error.csv')\n\n\nWe are now going to join horse attributes from the horses data set with the performance dataset.\n\n# Need to join color, sex, and import type with perf data.\nperf_clean = pd.merge(perf,horses[[\"horse_id\",\"colour\",\"sex\",\"import_type\"]],on=\"horse_id\",how = \"inner\")\n\nNow we are going to create a variable “podium” that is equal to 1 if a horse placed in the top 3 and 0 if it did not. This variable is what we will be trying to classify with a Categorical Naive Bayes Classifier.\n\nperf_clean['podium'] = np.nan\nperf_clean['podium'] = np.where(perf_clean['final_placing'].isin([1, 2, 3]), 1, 0)\n\nNow we will create a subset of data with our features of interest. Our features of interest are all of our categorical variables.\n\nperf_cat_classifier = perf_clean[['podium','colour','sex','import_type','draw','rating','days_between']]\nperf_cat_classifier = perf_cat_classifier.dropna()\n\nWith our feature set, we must now dummy code our categorical features into numbers in order for our Naive Bayes algorithim to be able to handle the features. We will be using sklearn’s preproccesing package.\n\nfrom sklearn import preprocessing\n\nperf_classifier_encode = perf_cat_classifier\n\nperf_classifier_encode = perf_classifier_encode.apply(preprocessing.LabelEncoder().fit_transform)\nperf_classifier_encode = pd.DataFrame(perf_classifier_encode)\n\n\nperf_classifier_encode.head(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npodium\ncolour\nsex\nimport_type\ndraw\nrating\ndays_between\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n3\n1\n5\n72\n22\n\n\n1\n0\n0\n3\n1\n0\n71\n24\n\n\n2\n0\n0\n3\n1\n0\n67\n246\n\n\n3\n0\n0\n3\n1\n8\n66\n67\n\n\n4\n0\n0\n3\n1\n13\n64\n135\n\n\n5\n0\n0\n3\n1\n6\n62\n11\n\n\n6\n0\n0\n3\n1\n13\n60\n20\n\n\n7\n1\n0\n3\n1\n3\n58\n11\n\n\n8\n1\n2\n3\n1\n6\n76\n13\n\n\n9\n1\n2\n3\n1\n3\n77\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature Selection for Multinomial Naive Bayes\nNow we are going to perform a feature selection process, so that we are using an optimal feature set for our NB classifier. We do not want to be including features in our classifier that detract from the effectivness of said classifier. We will now go ahead and define our feature set, which is all categorical and discrete numerical variables, and dependent variable, y (podium).\n\nx = np.array(perf_classifier_encode.loc[:, perf_classifier_encode.columns != 'podium'])\ny = np.array([perf_classifier_encode['podium']])\ny = y.transpose()\n\nWe will now go ahead and create a training, validation, and test set out of our data. The first 10 random indicies for our training, validation, and test splits are printed below\n\nimport random\nrandom.seed(100)\nN=x.shape[0]\nl = [*range(N)]     # indices\ncut = int(0.8 * N) #80% of the list\ncut2 = int((N - cut)/2 + cut)\nrandom.shuffle(l)   # randomize\ntrain_index = l[:cut] # first 80% of shuffled list\nvalidate_index = l[cut:cut2] # 10% of shuffled list\ntest_index = l[cut2:] # 10% of shuffled list\n\nprint(train_index[0:10])\nprint(validate_index[0:10])\nprint(test_index[0:10])\n\n[184317, 35142, 156934, 211440, 254189, 120768, 50992, 187576, 149295, 114769]\n[49235, 119729, 212655, 217398, 47295, 42808, 179741, 243627, 1139, 231747]\n[136214, 43047, 18090, 61177, 180581, 210039, 92160, 17150, 81449, 181451]\n\n\nWe will now go ahead and fit our model and find the precision of the model on both the training and test sets, along with the time it takes to evaluate the models. This fitting process should be fairly computationally inexpensive because our feature set is small, but it is still a good idea to check computing time with any model fitting. Precision is our metric of interest over any of the other evaluation metrics.\nThe reasoning for wanting to maximize precision over any of the other models is that precision tells us out of all the horse podium finishers we are predicting, we are predicting X percentage correct. In the betting world, being right is what makes you money. Measures like accuracy and negative predictive value, which help tell us how well our model is predicting horses that do NOT finish on the podium, are not helpful to us in a betting scenario. With a measure like sensitivity (recall), we are quantifying out of all the possible podium finishers, we are succesfully predicting X percentage of the total podium finisher pool. This measure is not totally unhelpful as it tells us the extent to which we are maximizing potential betting opportunities, but for the sake of this analysis, we care more about being right than maximizing potential betting opportunities, hence precision was our measure of interest for evaluating all of our models.\n\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\nfrom sklearn.metrics import precision_score\nimport time\n\n# Defining a function that generates a NB model\ndef train_MNB_model(X,Y,i_print=False):\n\n    if(i_print):\n        print(X.shape,Y.shape)\n\n    #SPLIT\n    x_train=X[train_index]\n    y_train=Y[train_index].flatten()\n\n    x_test=X[test_index]\n    y_test=Y[test_index].flatten()\n\n    # INITIALIZE MODEL \n    model = MultinomialNB()\n\n    # TRAIN MODEL \n    start = time.process_time()\n    model.fit(x_train,y_train)\n    time_train=time.process_time() - start\n\n    # LABEL PREDICTIONS FOR TRAINING AND TEST SET \n    start = time.process_time()\n    yp_train = model.predict(x_train)\n    yp_test = model.predict(x_test)\n    time_eval=time.process_time() - start\n\n    prec_train= precision_score(y_train, yp_train)*100\n    prec_test= precision_score(y_test, yp_test)*100\n\n    if(i_print):\n        print(prec_train,prec_test,time_train,time_eval)\n\n    return (prec_train,prec_test,time_train,time_eval)\n\n\n#TEST\nprint(type(x),type(y))\nprint(x.shape,y.shape)\n(acc_train,acc_test,time_train,time_eval)=train_MNB_model(x,y,i_print=True)\n\n&lt;class 'numpy.ndarray'&gt; &lt;class 'numpy.ndarray'&gt;\n(256936, 6) (256936, 1)\n(256936, 6) (256936, 1)\n27.903000561218498 27.27272727272727 0.051897600000017974 0.13326610000001438\n\n\nWith our initial model, we see a test precision of around 27%. Also, as expected, computational time is very low for both. Now, we will go ahead and analyze how each of the features impact our classifier, allowing us to determine if we should remove any features.\nWe will now peform an analysis to identify a best subset of features that gives us the best test precision. We will use the itertools package.\n\nimport itertools\nbest_prec = 0\nm = x.shape[1]\n\nfor i in range(1, m + 1):\n          subset = itertools.combinations(range(m),i)\n\n          for j in subset:\n               x_subset = x[:,j]\n               (prec_train,prec_test,time_train,time_eval)=train_MNB_model(x_subset,y,i_print=False)\n\n               if prec_test &gt; best_prec:\n                    best_prec = prec_test\n                    best_subset = x_subset\n\nprint(best_subset)\n\n/home/mcarswell/anaconda3/lib/python3.11/site-packages/sklearn/metrics/_classification.py:1344: UndefinedMetricWarning: Precision is ill-defined and being set to 0.0 due to no predicted samples.

We will now only be proceeding with these features.\n\n\nFitting a Final, “Optimal” NB Model\nWe will now use our subset of features to fit a final NB model. Our training model, consisting of the optimal feature set, will take a split of test data from the original dataset in order to give the model “unseen” data with classfication labels we already know, so that we can develop accurate metrics surrounding the performance of our model.\n\nx = np.array(perf_classifier_encode[['import_type','draw','rating']])\ny = np.array([perf_classifier_encode['podium']])\ny = y.transpose()\n\n\nimport random\nN=x.shape[0]\nl = [*range(N)]     # indices\ncut = int(0.8 * N) #80% of the list\ncut2 = int((N - cut)/2 + cut)\nrandom.shuffle(l)   # randomize\ntrain_index = l[:cut] # first 80% of shuffled list\nvalidate_index = l[cut:cut2] # 10% of shuffled list\ntest_index = l[cut2:] # 10% of shuffled list\n\n\n(acc_train,acc_test,time_train,time_eval)=train_MNB_model(x,y,i_print=True)\n\n(256936, 3) (256936, 1)\n33.54893138357705 35.189873417721515 0.04381219999999075 0.20717200000001412\n\n\nWe can see above that our model has a train precision of 33.5% test precision around 35% which is fairly decent. Because both our training and test precisions are very close in magnitude, with the test precision being slightly larger, we can conclude that our model is definitely not overfit as the test precision would be much lower if this were the case. There might be the argument that our model underfits the data because our test precision is so close to the train precision, and as you will see later, our F-1 score is pretty abysmal. We explore this idea in a little bit.\n\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, ConfusionMatrixDisplay\nfrom sklearn import metrics\nx_train=x[train_index]\ny_train=y[train_index].flatten()\n\nx_test=x[test_index]\ny_test=y[test_index].flatten()\n\nclf = MultinomialNB()\nclf.fit(x_train,y_train)\n\nyp_test = clf.predict(x_test)\ncm = confusion_matrix(y_test, yp_test)\ndisp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix=cm)\ndisp.plot()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nAccuracy = metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, yp_test)\nPrecision = metrics.precision_score(y_test, yp_test)\nSensitivity = metrics.recall_score(y_test, yp_test)\nSpecificity = metrics.recall_score(y_test, yp_test,pos_label=0)\nF1_score = metrics.f1_score(y_test, yp_test)\nprint(\"Accuracy:\",Accuracy*100)\nprint(\"Precision:\", Precision*100)\nprint(\"Sensitivity:\",Sensitivity*100)\nprint(\"Specificity:\",Specificity*100)\nprint(\"F1 Score:\",F1_score*100)\n\nAccuracy: 73.66311201058613\nPrecision: 35.189873417721515\nSensitivity: 2.0902255639097747\nSpecificity: 98.65574459147238\nF1 Score: 3.946061036195883\n\n\nWe can notice a few things. First of all, our model is about 73% accurate which is very strong. At the surface level, our precision is also fairly strong at around 35%. Of the horse podium finishers predicted, our model predicts correctly predicts them as podium finishers 35% of the time. HOWEVER, our confusion matrix shows that our model only predicted 139 out of the over 20,0000 observations as correctly positive podium finishers. We can see in the confusion matrix that the model is REALLY good at predicting non-podium finishers with a specificity of around 99%. This characteristic is not really impressive in practicality, however, as we are really just interested in predicting horse podium finishers. Resultantly, our ability in predicting positive results is very low, with an EXTREMELY low sensitity score. Our F-1 score is also VERY low, showing that this model is overall not very effective at all for predicting horse racing podium finishes. This characteristic is also an indication that our model is very underfitted as we are not capturing all neccessary patterns and behaviors neccessary for correctly prediciting podium finishes.\n\n\nConclusion\nOverall, our model is not a fantastic overall tool for predicting horse podium finishers. What is a valuable takeaway from this exercise, however, is we can very strongly observe what characteristics drive a horse to NOT finsh on the podium. A horse’s attributes like color and sex (which delineate what type of horse we are observing) really do not have any impact on the probability a horse has a podium finish. A horse’s import type can, however, be used to help inform if a horse will likely not finish on the podium. Rating and draw are the most important features here. Our model is able to show us that given a horse’s draw and rating, we can discount its likelihood to finish on the podium if its draw and rating are below a certain threshold. While this threshold is not clearly defined yet, this phenomena does allow us to understand that draw and rating will be important features as we continue to try and predict horse performance with more advanced statistical methods. These findings will be reported in the final conclusive report generated for this project, along with being used as the basis for much of the feature selection we use as we go forth developing more advanced models in this project, especially as we try to increase precision scores under the decision tree section."
